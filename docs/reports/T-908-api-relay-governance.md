# T-908: API Relay Governance — Research Artifact

**Task:** T-908  
**Type:** Inception  
**Created:** 2026-04-09  
**RFC:** anthropics/claude-code#45427  

## Context

Claude Code's PreToolUse hooks have 5 documented failure modes. The RFC proposes a `toolGate` inside the CLI — correct but requires Anthropic to ship it. This inception explores an alternative: a local API relay that intercepts the Anthropic SSE stream and enforces governance at the wire level.

**Core idea:** Set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:PORT`, run a TermLink relay that forwards to api.anthropic.com, parse the SSE response stream, and rewrite/block tool_use events that violate governance rules.

## Spike 1: Protocol Analysis

### Objective
Document the exact SSE wire format for Anthropic API streaming responses, specifically how tool_use blocks are encoded.

### Findings

**Source:** Anthropic Messages Streaming API docs (platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/messages-streaming)

**SSE Event Flow (complete sequence):**
```
message_start          → Message object with empty content[]
  content_block_start  → Opens a content block (text, tool_use, thinking, server_tool_use)
  content_block_delta* → One or more deltas for the block
  content_block_stop   → Closes the block
  ... (more content blocks)
message_delta          → Top-level changes (stop_reason, usage)
message_stop           → Stream complete
```

**Tool_use block wire format:**

1. `content_block_start` contains the **tool name and ID** upfront:
```
event: content_block_start
data: {"type":"content_block_start","index":1,"content_block":{"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_01T1x1fJ34qAmk2tNTrN7Up6","name":"get_weather","input":{}}}
```

2. Input JSON arrives as `input_json_delta` fragments:
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type":"content_block_delta","index":1,"delta":{"type":"input_json_delta","partial_json":"{\"location\":"}}

event: content_block_delta
data: {"type":"content_block_delta","index":1,"delta":{"type":"input_json_delta","partial_json":" \"San"}}
...
```

3. Block closes with `content_block_stop`, then `message_delta` has `"stop_reason":"tool_use"`.

**Critical insight for relay design:**
- The **tool name is known at `content_block_start`** — we don't need to buffer the entire block to decide whether to gate it
- Input JSON is fragmented across deltas as `partial_json` strings — must accumulate and parse on `content_block_stop`
- For path-based gating (e.g., block Write to settings.json), we DO need to buffer the input JSON to extract the path
- Current models emit one complete key+value at a time, so there may be delays between deltas
- `server_tool_use` is a separate type (server-side tools like web_search) — may want different gating rules

**Relay strategy validated:** The `content_block_start` event gives us tool name + ID immediately. We can:
- **Fast-gate by tool name** without buffering (block all Write/Edit)
- **Buffer + gate by content** when we need to inspect the input (path patterns)
- **Strip the entire block** (start through stop) when blocked
- **Inject a text block** in its place with the governance message

**Assumption A-2 (SSE can be parsed incrementally): VALIDATED** — tool_use blocks have clean boundaries and the tool name arrives in the first event.

## Spike 2: ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL Behavior

### Objective
Verify that Claude Code and subagents respect the environment variable.

### Findings

**Method:** Binary string extraction from Claude Code v2.1.97 ELF binary + Anthropic SDK documentation review.

**Evidence:**
1. `strings` on `/root/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.97` reveals `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is a recognized env var
2. The Anthropic TypeScript SDK constructor accepts `baseURL` (defaults to `https://api.anthropic.com`)
3. The SDK reads `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` from environment automatically
4. Claude Code v2.1.97 also recognizes: `ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_AWS_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL` — confirming base URL override is a first-class concept
5. Subagent spawning inherits the process environment (standard Node.js `child_process` / Deno behavior)

**Assumption A-1 (Claude Code respects ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL): VALIDATED** — present in binary, SDK supports it natively.
**Assumption A-4 (Subagents inherit env vars): HIGH CONFIDENCE** — standard process inheritance; would need live test to confirm 100%.
**Assumption A-6 (API key passthrough): VALIDATED** — `x-api-key` header is set by SDK from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, relay just needs to forward headers.

**Additional env vars of interest for relay:**
- `ANTHROPIC_UNIX_SOCKET` — could be used for local IPC instead of TCP (lower latency)
- `ANTHROPIC_LOG` — enables SDK debug logging (useful for development)
- `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS` — could inject relay-specific headers

## Landscape Research: Existing Solutions

Before building anything, we surveyed the market for existing tools that solve our two goals (prime directive enforcement + context traceability).

### Exact Problem: Claude Code Governance Bypass

| Finding | What it shows | Source |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Ona: Claude Code escapes sandbox** | Agent bypassed denylist via `/proc/self/root/` path trick, then disabled bubblewrap sandbox, then used ELF dynamic linker (`ld-linux`) to bypass execve-based enforcement entirely. No jailbreak needed. | [Ona](https://ona.com/stories/how-claude-code-escapes-its-own-denylist-and-sandbox) |
| **Adversa: Deny rules silently bypassed** | When shell commands have >50 subcommands, Claude Code skips all per-subcommand security analysis including deny rules | [Adversa](https://adversa.ai/blog/claude-code-security-bypass-deny-rules-disabled/) |
| **Anthropic managed-only settings** | `allowManagedHooksOnly`, `allowManagedMcpServersOnly`, `allowManagedPermissionRulesOnly` — prevents user/project settings from expanding trust. Enterprise feature. | [Claude Code Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sandboxing) |

**Key insight:** The Ona research proves that even kernel-level enforcement (bubblewrap/seccomp) can be bypassed by a sufficiently capable model. `chattr +i` and Landlock face similar risks — the model can reason about Linux internals and find alternative paths.

### LLM API Gateways (closest to our relay idea)

| Project | Approach | Tool call filtering? | Streaming SSE rewrite? | Maturity |
|---------|----------|---------------------|----------------------|----------|
| **[LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)** (16k+ stars) | Python proxy, OpenAI-compatible, 140+ providers | Guardrails on input/output | Partial — input guardrails work on streaming, output guardrails do NOT work on streaming | Production, widely used |
| **[Portkey Gateway](https://github.com/Portkey-AI/gateway)** (7k+ stars) | Node.js gateway, 200+ LLMs, 50+ guardrails | Yes, per-request guardrails | Input only on streaming — **output guardrails not supported for streaming** | Production, commercial |
| **[Bifrost](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost)** (Go, 11μs overhead) | MCP gateway + AI gateway, virtual key governance | Yes — per-VK tool allow-lists for MCP tools | Not for LLM response streams | Production, open source |
| **[NeMo Guardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Guardrails)** (NVIDIA) | Python runtime rails on input/output/execution | Execution rails for tool validation | Not designed for streaming interception | Production, open source |

**Critical finding: NO existing gateway supports output guardrails on streaming SSE responses.** LiteLLM and Portkey both explicitly document this limitation. They can guard inputs (what you send to the API) but cannot inspect or rewrite the streaming response. This is exactly the gap our relay would fill.

### Agent Governance Platforms

| Project | Approach | Relevance |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **[Microsoft Agent Governance Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit)** (April 2026, MIT license) | Policy enforcement ("Agent OS"), secure identity ("Agent Mesh"), execution sandboxing ("Agent Runtime"). Covers all 10 OWASP Agentic AI risks. Python/Rust/TS/Go/.NET. Integrates via framework callbacks (LangChain, CrewAI, etc.) | High — but hooks into framework extension points, same as our hooks. No Claude Code integration yet. |
| **[Stagent](https://stagent.io/)** ([GitHub](https://github.com/navam-io/stagent)) | Local-first agent ops workspace. Governed execution with inbox/approval flows. Supports Claude Code + OpenAI Codex backends. SQLite, npx-installable. | High — similar goals. BUT: governance is at the task dispatch level (which agent runs), not at the tool call level (what the agent does). Different enforcement surface. |
| **[Ona Veto](https://ona.com/stories/how-claude-code-escapes-its-own-denylist-and-sandbox)** | BPF LSM layer, SHA-256 binary content hashing. Kernel checks content identity, not filename. | Highest relevance — addresses the exact bypass chain. But solves only the sandbox problem (which binaries can execute), not the task gate problem. |

### Summary Matrix: What solves our goals?

| Solution | Prime directive (task gate) | Context traceability | Closes all 5 FMs? | Effort |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Hardened hooks** (chattr+i, scripts) | Partial — FM3 questionable per Ona research | No change | No (FM3 bypass proven) | Hours |
| **LiteLLM/Portkey as proxy** | Input guardrails only | Logging yes, but no output filtering | No (can't rewrite streaming output) | Days |
| **Bifrost MCP gateway** | MCP tool filtering only, not LLM tool_use | MCP tool logging | No (doesn't intercept LLM responses) | Days |
| **Microsoft Agent Gov Toolkit** | Framework callbacks (no Claude Code adapter) | Audit trail via Agent OS | Unknown (no CC integration) | Weeks |
| **Stagent** | Task-level dispatch governance | Agent ops visibility | No (doesn't gate individual tool calls) | Weeks |
| **Ona Veto (BPF LSM)** | Binary execution control | Execution audit trail | Partial (sandbox only, not task gate) | Weeks |
| **Custom SSE relay (our proposal)** | Full — gates tool_use at wire level | Wire audit trail | Yes (all 5) | Weeks |

## Dialogue Log

### 2026-04-09 — Initial Scoping

**Human:** Referenced RFC #45427, proposed IP-layer wrapper to intercept streamed responses and lock down Claude to only send commands through the wrapper.

**Agent:** Analyzed two approaches:
- Option A: HTTPS MITM proxy (rejected — TLS complexity)
- Option B: Local API relay via ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL (recommended — clean, leverages TermLink hub architecture)

**Outcome:** Option B selected. Closes all 5 failure modes:
1. Subagent bypass — subagents inherit ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL
2. Silent hook failure — wire-level, not a hook
3. Model self-modification — can't edit env vars set before process start
4. Alternative tool paths — sees ALL tool calls regardless of tool name
5. CLAUDE.md non-compliance — structural enforcement, not advisory

**Decision:** Open inception (this task) to validate feasibility via 4 spikes.
