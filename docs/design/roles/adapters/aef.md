# Adapter: role cards on the Agentic Engineering Framework (AEF)

How the portable concepts in `../cards/` map onto AEF. Given to a role together with its card and the
estate profile. A project on another framework writes its own adapter; the cards stay the same.

## A1 Step and task

| Card concept | In AEF |
|---|---|
| A1.1 The step's task | A task file in `.tasks/active/` named in `../../role-chain.yaml` |
| A1.2 Start a step | The orchestrator runs `python3 scripts/role-chain.py next docs/designs/agent-authorization-broker/role-chain.yaml` (it runs `.agentic-framework/bin/fw work-on T-XXXX`) |
| A1.3 Save after each unit | `.agentic-framework/bin/fw git commit -m "T-XXXX: ..."`, explicit paths only, never `git add -A` |
| A1.4 Write only your own output | Your output path from the chain file; nothing else |
| A1.5 Change request to an earlier step | In the hand-back; the orchestrator reopens that step's task |
| A1.6 Run the role in its own session (T-2214) | The orchestrator runs `python3 scripts/role-chain.py dispatch <chain> <N>`. It refuses unless step N is next under the gate. It writes the brief `handbacks/step-NN-brief.md` (the prompt files in order, then the binding step facts F.1–F.9) and starts `fw termlink dispatch` (session `role-NN-<role>`, tools Read/Write/Edit/Bash/Glob/Grep, no MCP). It verifies the worker started and records `handbacks/step-NN-dispatch.json`. Then `role-chain.py collect <chain> <N>` waits and checks the hand-back. The orchestrator commits the brief and the dispatch record |
| A1.7 Limits of A1.6 today | 1) The role worker is the claude kind: `fw termlink dispatch` runs codex/opencode workers only for reviews (T-3582; upstream request filed under T-2214). 2) Dispatch kick-off is fire-and-forget (T-1648); A1.6 verifies the start and exits 5 if none. 3) Sessions share one TermLink identity (RR-3). 4) The role session shares the project's focus file with the orchestrator (G-191), so the orchestrator re-runs `fw context focus` after a dispatch. 5) Interactive steps (the requirements interview) still run in the orchestrator's session with the operator |

## A2 Review and approval

A2.1 The project's review policy is the framework's, unchanged: D-626 (`.agentic-framework/lib/delegation.py`:
reviewer-closeable, reviewer-judges, operator-only) and IW-7 (`.agentic-framework/lib/review_policy.py`: the
risk assessment sets the review strength, from one independent agent to a multi-vendor panel).
A2.1b **Order at the end of every step (operator 2026-10-04, T-2213):** hand-back → independent review
`.agentic-framework/bin/fw reviewer judge T-XXXX` on the criterion "[REVIEW] Independent review: step N ..." (rung
per IW-7; step tasks carry the `security` tag, so rung 5) → on a valid green, `fw reviewer verdict apply` ticks that
criterion → operator approval only where the step `decides: true` → `scripts/role-chain.py next`. The operator's
approval criterion MUST carry the line `**Sovereignty:** operator decision only; ...`: the framework classifies a
criterion operator-only by its wording (`delegation._SOVEREIGNTY_FIELD_RE`); without it an approval can be routed to
agent reviewers (found on step 2, 2026-10-04). The driver refuses
to start the next step without the ticked review.
A2.2 The orchestrator dispatches the review (`.agentic-framework/bin/fw reviewer judge T-XXXX`); the verdict is
recorded with the digest of what was reviewed. Positive → the chain advances; negative → findings go back to
the role; escalate or an operator-only criterion → the human.
A2.3 Constraint while upstream P-2026-1001-023 is open: no review run may overlap another commit (the judge's
commit sweeps the shared git index; T-2205).

## A3 Hand-back record

A3.0 Save the record in the repository first, at `docs/designs/agent-authorization-broker/handbacks/step-NN-<role>.json`, and commit it (a bus blob only stores a path; a scratch path is not durable).
A3.1 Post it on the result bus: `.agentic-framework/bin/fw bus post --task T-XXXX --agent <role> --summary "<one line>" --blob <handback.json>`.
A3.2 Hash with `sha256sum` of the committed output file.
A3.3 Check the record before handing back (T-2212): `python3 scripts/role-handback-check.py <record.json> --card <role card>`. The
format is `docs/designs/agent-authorization-broker/schemas/role-handback-1.schema.json`; the checker also verifies the output
and input hashes and the number of completion items against the card.

A3.4 Peers on another hub (T-2211, until P-2026-1004-001 is fixed): `fw sidecar send --hub` cannot deliver. Address
the peer by its full circuit id and post directly: `termlink channel post inbox:<peer-hub-id>/<peer> --hub <host:port>
--msg-type sidecar.consult --payload ... --metadata from_project=proxmox-ring20-management`, then send a receipt with
`termlink channel ack <topic> --hub <host:port>` when answering a peer's consult.

## A3b Drawings (common rules 3.6, T-2219)

A3b.1 Format: Mermaid fenced blocks (```` ```mermaid ````) in the output Markdown. Use `flowchart` for structure
(components, boundaries as `subgraph`, attack trees, maps), `sequenceDiagram` for step sequences, `stateDiagram-v2`
for lifecycles and state machines. Put the drawing id in the caption line just above the block, e.g.
`**Drawing D-2 — approval sequence**`, and the numbered textual equivalent just below it.
A3b.2 Render check: Watchtower renders design documents with a locally bundled Mermaid
(`http://192.168.10.122:3000/design/<doc-name>`); a block that fails to parse shows a red error box. Before handing
back, run `python3 scripts/design-render-check.py <output.md> --out docs/designs/agent-authorization-broker/handbacks/step-NN-render-check.json`
(headless browser; passes only when every block is an SVG and none errors), commit the record and name it in the
hand-back as `render_check`. Line breaks inside labels are `<br/>`; quote labels that contain parentheses, colons
or `#`; never put `;` in a `sequenceDiagram` message or note (it ends the statement and the diagram fails to parse).
A3b.3 The hand-back checker counts the Mermaid blocks and the `D-n` captions against the card's required
drawings, and refuses a record without a passing render check for exactly this output (same sha256).

## A4 Work items (planner)

A4.1 Draft the plan in the output document. After the human approves it:
`.agentic-framework/bin/fw task create --name "..." --description "..." --type build|test|refactor|decommission|inception --owner agent|human --tags "arc-008,..." --horizon now|next|later`.
A4.2 Fill each task: Context (design sections, R-n, E-n), Agent ACs (from E-n), Human ACs only for real
judgement (Steps / Expected / If not), `## Verification`, `## Evolution` for arc tasks, `## RCA` for bugs.
The G-020 gate refuses placeholder ACs.
A4.3 Verification lines run under pipefail without errexit (P-011). Capture to a private file, not a shared
name: `out=$(mktemp) && cmd > "$out" 2>&1 && grep -q PAT "$out"`. Put the assertion last.
A4.4 Dependencies: AEF has no enforced dependency field yet (requested upstream). Interim: a `depends_on:` list
in the task frontmatter (read by the plan and the chain driver, not by the framework), a `Depends on: T-XXXX
(why)` line in Context, the ids in `related_tasks:`; hard ordering through a chain file driven by
`scripts/role-chain.py`. Horizon is priority, not dependency.
A4.5 Explorations are inceptions; `fw inception decide` is the human's. Build tasks that carry out a GO declare
`unlocks_inception_decision: [T-XXXX:<decision-id>]`.
A4.6 Plan item ids map to task ids in the plan document, so a re-run reconciles.

## A5 Search and memory

A5.1 Open work: `python3 scripts/task-prior-art.py --query "<distinctive term>"`. Components:
`.agentic-framework/bin/fw fabric search <term>`. Recorded weaknesses: `.context/project/concerns.yaml`.
Reports: `docs/reports/`.
A5.2 Decision records: the step task's `## Decisions` plus the design document's decision section (one
store per decision, the other links to it).
A5.3 New source files are registered with `.agentic-framework/bin/fw fabric register <path>`.

## A6 Limits to state honestly

A6.1 The framework's gates are hooks of the harness that runs them (Claude Code, OpenCode). A role session in a
harness without those hooks works on convention; the orchestrator's review and the chain driver are then the
only enforcement.
