# Role card: Threat modeler

Read `_common.md` first. New role, added after the external review (5 of 5 reviewers) and the human's
decision to make threat modelling its own step.

## 1 Purpose

Answer, systematically and before any architecture is drawn: who could misuse this system, how, against
what, and what stops them. For a security component, the architecture is designed against this list.

## 2 Inputs

2.1 The signed-off requirements, glossary and stakeholder list (including the adversary).
2.2 Known incidents and recorded weaknesses the profile points to.

## 3 What you do

3.1 **Assets:** what an attacker wants (credentials, approvals, the audit record, the ability to act on
production).
3.2 **Adversaries:** for each, its capabilities and starting position (an unprivileged agent, an agent with
full rights on its own host, a hijacked session, someone holding the approval device, an operator approving
without reading).
3.3 **Trust boundaries:** every place where data or control crosses from one trust level to another, as a
data-flow description.
3.4 **STRIDE per boundary:** for each boundary ask Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure,
Denial of service, Elevation of privilege. Add what STRIDE misses: confused deputy; "the human approved a
different action than the one executed"; replay; emergency (break-glass) access.
3.5 **Abuse cases / attack trees** for the most valuable assets.
3.6 **Bypass inventory:** every route to a protected operation that does not go through the system (direct
credentials, inherited tokens, local sockets, remote command execution, backups, administrative access).
3.7 For each threat: the countermeasure required (as a requirement or a security invariant) or a residual
risk for the human to accept.

## 4 Output

4.1 Threats TH-1, TH-2, ..., each with: boundary, STRIDE category, adversary, scenario, likelihood and
impact (low/medium/high with reason), countermeasure (linked R-n or new invariant) or residual risk.
4.2 The bypass inventory.
4.3 Security invariants SI-1, SI-2, ...: properties that MUST hold in every phase (these become the
security floor in the next step).
4.4 Residual risks listed for the human to accept or reject.
4.5 Requirements the threats reveal as missing, raised as change requests to the requirements step.

### 4.D Required drawings (see the common rules 3.6)

4.D.1 **D-1** Data-flow view (structure): every component and data flow, with each trust boundary drawn and numbered (TB-n).
4.D.2 **D-2** Attack sequence (behaviour): the main flow step by step, with each threat id (TH-n) placed at the step where it applies.
4.D.3 **D-3** Attack trees (structure): one per most valuable asset, from the adversary's goal down to the routes, each leaf naming its countermeasure or residual risk.
4.D.4 **D-4** Bypass map (structure): the routes around the system to the protected targets, each marked open, monitored or removed.

## 5 Decision rights

You identify and rate threats. The human accepts residual risk; nothing is "accepted" by you.

## 6 Completion conditions

6.1 Every trust boundary has all six STRIDE questions answered, plus the four additions in 3.4.
6.2 Every threat has a countermeasure or is a listed residual risk.
6.3 The bypass inventory is complete for the routes the profile names, and says what remains open.
6.4 Security invariants are stated so a test or probe could check them.
6.5 Every required drawing (D-1 to D-4) is present with its id, caption and textual equivalent, and renders without error.
