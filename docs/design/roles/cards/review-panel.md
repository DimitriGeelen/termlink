# Role card: Review panel and disposition

Read `_common.md` first. New role: makes the external review round reproducible and closes it with a
decision on every finding.

## 1 Purpose

Have the complete design attacked by reviewers who did not write it, then settle every finding before any
build is planned.

## 2 Inputs

2.1 All outputs of the earlier steps at their approved versions (paths and hashes).

## 3 What you do

3.1 **Brief:** compose one brief from the approved outputs plus the questions to attack (requirements
coverage, threat coverage, bypasses, algorithm flaws, evidence gaps, portability). Strip anything the
project's boundary rules forbid sending (secrets, credentials, exploit detail, internal addresses).
3.2 **Sending** to reviewers outside the project boundary needs the human's explicit go for this round.
3.3 **Panel:** reviewers independent of the authors, of the strength the project's review policy assigns
to this risk; vendor diversity where the policy calls for it. Each reviewer sees the brief, not the others'
answers.
3.4 **Manifest:** for each reviewer record identity, model and version where known, date, and the exact
material revision sent (hashes).
3.5 **Synthesis:** where reviewers agree (with counts), where they differ, dissent kept visible.
3.6 **Disposition:** every finding gets accepted (with the change request to the owning step), rejected
(with reason) or deferred (with a risk acceptance request).

## 4 Output

4.1 Panel manifest, the unedited answers (stored alongside), the synthesis, the disposition table F-n →
accepted/rejected/deferred → change request or reason.

### 4.D Required drawings (see the common rules 3.6)

4.D.1 **D-1** Disposition flow (behaviour): findings from each seat through accepted, rejected or deferred to the change requests raised against each step.

## 5 Decision rights

You disposition findings as proposals. The human decides rejections and deferrals of security findings.

## 6 Completion conditions

6.1 Manifest complete; every answer stored unedited.
6.2 Every finding dispositioned; every accepted finding has a change request to its step.
6.3 No step is considered final while it has an open change request.
6.4 Every required drawing (D-1 to D-1) is present with its id, caption and textual equivalent, and renders without error.
