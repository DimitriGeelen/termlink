# Profile: the ring20 estate

Estate specifics a role needs in this project. Given to a role together with its card and the AEF adapter.

## P1 Rules

P1.1 The project's agent rules: `policy/agent-rules.md` (nothing leaves the estate; search the open queue
first; claim peer requests). They apply to every harness.
P1.2 Number everything, in the reading flow (operator standing rule).
P1.3 The operator is the only human approver. Operator-facing text is plain, numbered, with choices as
lettered lists; the operator may write in Dutch or English.

## P2 Where outputs are reviewed

P2.1 Step outputs are top-level files `docs/designs/agent-authorization-broker-NN-<name>.md`. The operator
reviews them inline at `http://192.168.10.122:3000/design/<name>`; "Submit review" sends the comments to the
ring20 inbox. Any repository Markdown renders at `http://192.168.10.122:3000/project/<path with -- for />`.
P2.2 The arc-008 design: `docs/designs/agent-authorization-broker.md`; the roles plan and its 22 requirement
questions: `docs/designs/agent-authorization-broker-roles-plan.md` section 6; the external review synthesis:
`docs/designs/agent-authorization-broker-roles-review.md`.

## P3 The estate

P3.1 Agents: ring20 sessions (infrastructure manager and this chain's orchestrator, several may run at once
under one TermLink identity), the Skills Manager Agent (SMA, `/opt/150-skills-manager`, reached only through
its direction protocol), the dashboard agent, Penelope (personal assistant), the framework agent (.107).
P3.2 Protected systems: Cloudron, Proxmox cluster, DNS, OneDev, Infisical, the skills server.
P3.3 Known incidents and weaknesses to use as evidence: `docs/reports/T-2153-rca.md`,
`docs/reports/T-2180-external-publish-rca.md`, `docs/reports/T-2164-production-mutation-gate.md`, gaps
G-217 to G-222 in `.context/project/concerns.yaml`. Do not copy open-weakness detail into anything that may
leave the estate.

## P4 Tools in this estate

P4.1 Scripts are Python 3 or bash. Tests: hermetic `tests/test-*.py` (PASS/FAIL lines, exit code).
P4.2 Browser evidence for the approval page: Playwright (MCP in Claude Code); screenshots under
`.playwright-mcp/`, read and checked in every visual mode affected.
P4.3 Orchestration: TermLink (sessions, channels, claims, artifact transfer), with ring20 as orchestrator
(inception T-2206). Role sessions get messages and artifacts only, never command execution or keystroke
injection into other sessions.
P4.4 External review panels: `scripts/t2166-consult.py` with `CONSULT_BRIEF`, `CONSULT_OUT`, `CONSULT_TAG`
(three subscription seats, two paid OpenRouter seats); the operator's explicit go each round.
