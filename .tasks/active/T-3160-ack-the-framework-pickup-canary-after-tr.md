# T-3160: Ack the framework-pickup canary after triaging offsets 171/172

## Context

**PARKED 2026-09-26 — the ack is not earned yet, and acking anyway would be the exact
failure the canary exists to prevent.**

The task assumed two surfaced filings (offsets 171, 172). Running the canary before acking
— which this task's own first AC requires, precisely so the ack answers a measured state —
revealed **three**:

```
off=168  FOR STRUCTURAL INCORPORATION — 832 T-856 (BVP scoring as an approval step)
off=171  USER-FACING BUG + FIX in your Watchtower app — 832 T-858   [triaged, T-3158]
off=172  CALIBRATION FINDING in the BVP estimator — 832 T-854       [triaged, T-3159]
```

171 and 172 are triaged, with replies posted and read back (offsets 176, 177). **168 is
not, and cannot be by an agent.** It proposes changing the §ACD sovereignty gate so that
`fw bvp confirm` no longer requires human approval — a governance-model change, which this
run's mandate says must be surfaced rather than decided. 832 say so themselves: *"whether
it belongs in the framework default is yours."*

`--ack` bumps a single watermark to the newest offset; there is no partial ack. So acking
now would silently mark 168 as processed, and a governance proposal awaiting an operator
ruling would go quiet with nobody having ruled — G-063 reintroduced by the very command
documented to clear it.

**The canary therefore stays firing on purpose.** That is the correct state: there IS
unprocessed inbound work. Parked rather than completed because its precondition is unmet,
not because the work was hard.

Unparks when the operator rules on 168 (surfaced as the top Sovereign question in this
run's handback).

<!-- One sentence for small tasks. Link to design docs for substantial ones. -->

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [ ] The canary's **firing state is observed before acking**, so the ack is a response to a measured condition rather than a reflex.
- [ ] The ack is **earned**: both surfaced filings (offsets 171 and 172) were genuinely triaged, with replies posted and read back from the topic (T-3158 offset 176, T-3159 offset 177). Acking un-triaged filings would reintroduce the exact G-063 miss the canary exists to prevent.
- [ ] The ack is performed **through the script's own `--ack` path**, not by hand-editing `.context/working/.framework-pickup-canary.seen-offset`.
- [ ] The canary is **re-run after the ack and confirmed quiet (exit 0)** — an ack whose effect is assumed rather than observed is the same vacuous-pass class this session has been closing all day.
- [ ] `## Decisions` left EMPTY (the auto-capture mitigation, now 4/4).

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX > /tmp/.rev 2>&1 && grep -q "Overall:.*PASS" /tmp/.rev`
       added to ## Verification. NEVER `... 2>&1 | grep -q ...` — that is the shape the
       Pipefail/SIGPIPE section below forbids, and this line used to prescribe it.
-->

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# ── Pipefail/SIGPIPE: grepping a command's output (L-387, T-2090, T-2743, T-2738) ──
#
# THE DEFAULT — redirect to a file, then grep the file:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
#     curl -sf "$(bin/fw watchtower url)/page" -o /tmp/.out && grep -q "PAT" /tmp/.out
# Correct at any output size, and `&&` keeps the PRODUCING command's exit code in
# the verdict. Reach for this first; the alternative below is the special case.
#
# NEVER `cmd | grep -q PAT` (L-387) — why: P-011 runs each line under `set -eo
# pipefail`. When grep matches it exits and closes stdin while cmd is still
# writing, cmd takes SIGPIPE, the pipeline exits 141 — verification "fails" with
# the pattern present. Captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863).
#
# THE EXCEPTION — capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Valid ONLY while "$out" fits the 65536-byte pipe buffer, and it is on you to
# know that it does. Above that the form inverts and becomes the very failure
# L-387 describes: echo blocks on the full pipe, grep -q exits, echo takes
# SIGPIPE, rc=141 (T-2743 — measured on a 146,366-byte Watchtower page, 3/3 runs,
# deterministic not racy; rendered routes run 50-200KB, so anything that curls a
# page is over the line). It also discards cmd's exit code, so a 404 yields an
# empty capture that grep merely fails to match rather than a failed line.
# If you do use it: single pipe only, no intermediate tail/awk/sed stage between
# capture and grep (T-2090) — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its stdin
# on, and grep scans the whole captured string anyway, so the `tail -3` was
# cosmetic. `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`, nothing between.
#
# ── Asserting an ABSENCE: prove the search could have succeeded (T-3144) ──
#
# `! grep -q "PATTERN" file` exits 0 when the pattern is absent. It ALSO exits 0
# when the file was renamed, deleted, or is empty — so the leg cannot distinguish
# "the bad thing is not there" from "I could not look", and the gate reports green
# over a check that never ran. Pair every absence assertion with something that
# fails if the search could not happen:
#
#     test -f path/to/file && ! grep -q "PATTERN" path/to/file    # existence first
#     grep -q "KNOWN_MARKER" f && ! grep -q "PATTERN" f           # positive companion
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && ! grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out       # &&-joined producer
#
# Count-equals-zero is the same defect wearing a different hat, and it is the one
# that bites hardest over a COMMAND's output rather than a file:
#
#     [ "$(cargo clippy --workspace 2>&1 | grep -c "^error")" = "0" ]   # WRONG
#
# If cargo is missing, or dies before emitting diagnostics, there are no `^error`
# lines, the count is 0, and the leg passes — a build gate that goes green
# precisely when the build could not run. Measured in this corpus, not invented.
# Keep the producer's exit code in the verdict:
#
#     cargo clippy --workspace > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && ! grep -q "^error" /tmp/.out
#
# T-3144 censused 2853 task files: 71 absence assertions, 41 already correct, 30
# not. The convention mostly works — this note is here so the next one is written
# right, because a vacuous leg is invisible until the day the path moves.
#
# TEST RUNNERS need a guard either way (T-2738). `set -e` is suppressed inside the
# `if` condition the gate runs each line in, so in `cmd1; cmd2` only cmd2 is the
# verdict — and the pass marker you grep for survives a partial failure: a suite
# printing "3 failed, 9 passed" satisfies `grep -q "9 passed"`, and generalising
# to `grep -qE "[0-9]+ passed"` matches the same output. Keep the exit code:
#     python3 -m pytest <file> -q > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q passed /tmp/.out
# or add the guard the exit code used to supply:
#     out=$(python3 -m pytest <file> -q 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q passed && ! echo "$out" | grep -q failed
#     out=$(bats <file> 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q '^ok 1 ' && ! echo "$out" | grep -q '^not ok'
# The close gate refuses the unguarded form. Bypass: FW_ALLOW_UNJUDGED_TEST_RUN=1.
#
# REHEARSING A LINE BY HAND DOES NOT REHEARSE THE GATE (T-2743). Your interactive
# shell has no `set -eo pipefail`. A line has returned 0 by hand and 141 under
# P-011, from the same directory, the same second. To rehearse for real:
#     bash -c 'set -eo pipefail; <your verification line>'
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Recommendation

<!-- T-2945: same shape as inception.md's block — the gate that reads it
     (audit_inception_recommendation, lib/task-audit.sh:117) is shared, so the
     shape is copied rather than reinvented.

     REQUIRED once this task reaches partial-complete: Agent ACs done, at least
     one `### Human` AC still unticked. `lib/review.sh:205-211` (T-2421) BLOCKS
     `fw task review` emission for build/refactor/test/decommission tasks in that
     state with no substantive block here — the operator would otherwise open
     /review/<id> to a blank Recommendation card and be asked to approve a form.

     Not required while every Human AC is ticked or the task has none: the gate
     only fires on the partial-complete transition. It is here from the start so
     you write it while you still have the evidence, not when the gate refuses.

     Format (the parser wants the `**Recommendation:**` line at the start of a
     line; a leading `-` or `*` bullet is also accepted):
     **Recommendation:** GO / NO-GO / DEFER
     **Rationale:** Why (cite evidence — what shipped, what was proven, what remains)
     **Evidence:**
     - Finding 1
     - Finding 2

     DEFER is for evidence gaps, not confidence gaps (CLAUDE.md §Presenting Work
     for Human Review). If the artefact is complete and you still don't want to
     commit, that is a calibration failure — recommend GO or NO-GO.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
