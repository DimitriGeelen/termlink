name: "checkpoint.sh has no 'budget' subcommand — the G-087-safe read /resume prescribes
  is unimplemented"
description: >
  The /resume skill instructs: read the budget cache via '.agentic-framework/agents/context/checkpoint.sh
  budget' and explicitly NOT via a raw cat of .context/working/.budget-status, citing
  G-087/T-222 (a failed transcript scan or foreign-session cache reads back as a plausible
  healthy zero; measured twice in production, 0 vs 297923 and 0 vs 70549). The vendored
  checkpoint.sh implements only {post-tool|reset|status} — 'budget' exits 1 and trips
  the hook-crash banner. So the ONLY read the framework certifies as safe is the one
  that does not exist, and the documented alternative is the one it forbids. Reproduced
  twice this session. Vendored under .agentic-framework/ so per G-062 this is filed
  upstream at framework:pickup, not patched locally.

# T-3034: checkpoint.sh has no 'budget' subcommand — the G-087-safe read /resume prescribes is unimplemented

## Context

<!-- One sentence for small tasks. Link to design docs for substantial ones. -->

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [ ] The defect is reproduced by a recorded check, not asserted: invoking
      `.agentic-framework/agents/context/checkpoint.sh budget` exits non-zero and its
      own usage line offers only `{post-tool|reset|status}` — `budget` is absent
- [ ] The contradiction is stated in this task: `/resume` step 6 prescribes the
      `budget` subcommand AND explicitly forbids the raw `cat` of
      `.context/working/.budget-status` (G-087/T-222), so the only read the framework
      certifies as safe is unimplemented and the only implemented read is forbidden
- [ ] No local patch is made under `.agentic-framework/` (G-062: a local fix to
      vendored code is deleted by the next re-vendor) — verified by a clean porcelain
- [ ] The defect is filed upstream at `framework:pickup` and the resulting offset is
      recorded in this task file, per CLAUDE.md: if you are writing a report to a file
      so a human can relay it, post it to the rail instead

## Verification

# T-3034. Safe redirect form only (L-387): never `cmd | grep -q PAT`.
# The subcommand is EXPECTED to fail, so capture first, then assert on the text.
.agentic-framework/agents/context/checkpoint.sh budget > /tmp/.t3034-b 2>&1 || true
grep -qF "post-tool|reset|status" /tmp/.t3034-b
grep -q "Usage: checkpoint.sh" /tmp/.t3034-b
# G-062: the vendored tree must carry no local patch.
git status --porcelain .agentic-framework/ > /tmp/.t3034-g 2>&1
test ! -s /tmp/.t3034-g
# The upstream filing offset must be recorded in this task file.
grep -q "framework:pickup@" .tasks/active/T-3034-checkpointsh-has-no-budget-subcommand--t.md

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Recommendation

<!-- T-2945: same shape as inception.md's block — the gate that reads it
     (audit_inception_recommendation, lib/task-audit.sh:117) is shared, so the
     shape is copied rather than reinvented.

     REQUIRED once this task reaches partial-complete: Agent ACs done, at least
     one `### Human` AC still unticked. `lib/review.sh:205-211` (T-2421) BLOCKS
     `fw task review` emission for build/refactor/test/decommission tasks in that
     state with no substantive block here — the operator would otherwise open
     /review/<id> to a blank Recommendation card and be asked to approve a form.

     Not required while every Human AC is ticked or the task has none: the gate
     only fires on the partial-complete transition. It is here from the start so
     you write it while you still have the evidence, not when the gate refuses.

     Format (the parser wants the `**Recommendation:**` line at the start of a
     line; a leading `-` or `*` bullet is also accepted):
     **Recommendation:** GO / NO-GO / DEFER
     **Rationale:** Why (cite evidence — what shipped, what was proven, what remains)
     **Evidence:**
     - Finding 1
     - Finding 2

     DEFER is for evidence gaps, not confidence gaps (CLAUDE.md §Presenting Work
     for Human Review). If the artefact is complete and you still don't want to
     commit, that is a calibration failure — recommend GO or NO-GO.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
