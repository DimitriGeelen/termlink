# T-3169: Triage the framework:pickup queue - offsets 168, 180, 181 with operator decisions

## Problem Statement

<!-- What problem are we exploring? For whom? Why now? -->

## Assumptions

<!-- Key assumptions to test. Register with: fw assumption add "Statement" --task T-XXX -->

## Open Questions

<!-- T-2190 (T-2186 Slice 4): every IW-N question must be disposed before
     --status work-completed. Disposition gate (agents/task-create/update-task.sh
     check_disposition_gate) refuses on under-disposed inceptions.

     Per-question shape:

       - **IW-1: <question text>**
         confidence: 0-3      (your confidence in your current answer; 0=guess, 3=verified)
         disposition: answered | deferred | dissolved
         rationale: <one-line evidence — file:line, decision id, dialogue ref>

     Never bare yes/no — the gate refuses bare checkboxes. See 050-Inceptions.md
     §Disposition Gate. Bypass: --skip-disposition-gate "rationale" (direct) or
     FW_SKIP_DISPOSITION_GATE=1 (env-var, T-1890 producer/consumer parity).
-->

- **IW-1: Should the `--i-am-human` sovereignty gate be removed from `fw bvp confirm` (offset 168)?**
  confidence: 0
  disposition: answered|deferred|dissolved
  rationale: <operator ruling required — an agent must not decide to remove the human from a sovereignty gate>

- **IW-2: What do offsets 180 and 181 from 832-Workflow-designer actually report, and does either need a local task?**
  confidence: 0
  disposition: answered|deferred|dissolved
  rationale: <to fill — read and summarise>

- **IW-3: Once 168/180/181 are ruled on, is `--ack` honest, and does T-3160 unpark?**
  confidence: 1
  disposition: answered|deferred|dissolved
  rationale: <acking before the ruling would mark an undecided proposal processed — that is why T-3160 is parked and the canary fires on purpose>

## Exploration Plan

<!-- How will we validate assumptions? Spikes, prototypes, research? Time-box each. -->

## Technical Constraints

<!-- What platform, browser, network, or hardware constraints apply?
     For web apps: HTTPS requirements, browser API restrictions, CORS, device support.
     For hardware APIs (mic, camera, GPS, Bluetooth): access requirements, permissions model.
     For infrastructure: network topology, firewall rules, latency bounds.
     Fill this BEFORE building. Discovering constraints after implementation wastes sessions. -->

## Scope Fence

<!-- What's IN scope for this exploration? What's explicitly OUT? -->

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- @auto-tick-on-decide -->
- [ ] Problem statement validated
<!-- @auto-tick-on-decide -->
- [ ] Assumptions tested
<!-- @auto-tick-on-decide -->
- [ ] Recommendation written with rationale

### Human
<!-- @auto-tick-on-decide -->
- [ ] [REVIEW] Review exploration findings and approve go/no-go decision
  **Steps:**
  1. Run: `fw task review T-XXX` (opens Watchtower with recommendation, assumptions, research artifacts)
  2. Review the Agent Recommendation section and go/no-go criteria evaluation
  3. Record decision via the Watchtower form or the command shown alongside the QR code
  **Expected:** Decision recorded, task completed
  **If not:** Ask agent for clarification on specific findings

## Go/No-Go Criteria

<!-- Fill these BEFORE writing the recommendation. The placeholder detector will block review/decide if left empty. -->
**GO if:**
- Root cause identified with bounded fix path
- Fix is scoped, testable, and reversible

**NO-GO if:**
- Problem requires fundamental redesign or unbounded scope
- Fix cost exceeds benefit given current evidence

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# For inception tasks, verification is often not needed (decisions, not code).
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if a GO decision will mean editing *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml,
# *.go, Cargo.toml, tsconfig.json, or pom.xml in the build task, plan to add the
# matching build command (dotnet build / go build / cargo check / tsc --noEmit /
# mvn compile) to that build task's ## Verification — P-011 only runs what you write.

## Recommendation

**Recommendation:** DEFER

**Rationale:**

Three filings await operator rulings: offset 168 proposes removing the --i-am-human gate from fw bvp confirm (a sovereignty question an agent must not settle), and offsets 180/181 are newly-discovered untriaged inbound from 832-Workflow-designer. DEFER until each is read and the operator rules.

**Evidence:**

<!-- Add evidence bullets as exploration progresses (file paths,
     commit hashes, test results). The filing-time recommendation
     can be revised before fw inception decide. -->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion via: fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go --rationale "..." -->

## Updates

<!-- Auto-populated by git mining at task completion.
     Manual entries optional during execution. -->

### 2026-09-26T12:16:01Z — status-update [task-update-agent]
- **Change:** status: captured → started-work
