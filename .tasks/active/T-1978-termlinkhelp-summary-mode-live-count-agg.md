description: >
  Extend summary mode with live-count derivations: total_live_tools (= total_tools - total_deprecated), total_live_categories (count of categories with >=1 live tool), and largest_live_categories[5] (top-5 by LIVE tool count, not total). Composes with T-1977's exclude_deprecated axis: LLMs landing on summary see effective post-T-1166-retirement namespace sizes at first glance, instead of having to mentally subtract deprecated rows from the existing aggregates. All derived from the existing categories walk + is_deprecated() — no new source of truth.

# T-1978: termlink_help: summary mode live-count aggregates (live_tools, live_categories, largest_live_categories)

## Context

Cycle 11 of `termlink_help` hardening — slice 3 (slices 1-2 = T-1976 min_parameters, T-1977 exclude_deprecated). Summary mode already returns `total_tools` + `total_deprecated`; this slice adds live-count derivations so LLMs see effective post-retirement namespace sizes without computing them client-side. Composes thematically with the T-1977 axis.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [x] Summary mode adds `total_live_tools` field (== total_tools - total_deprecated)
- [x] Summary mode adds `total_live_categories` field (count of categories with >=1 live tool)
- [x] Summary mode adds `largest_live_categories` field — top-5 categories by LIVE tool count, `[{name, live_tool_count}, ...]` shape
- [x] Test: `summary_total_live_tools_equals_total_minus_deprecated` — arithmetic invariant locks the derivation
- [x] Test: `summary_largest_live_categories_ranked_by_live_count` — top entry has highest live count; live_tool_count > 0 for every entry
- [x] Test: `summary_total_live_categories_matches_walk` — independent walk of categories with >=1 live tool equals the reported count
- [x] Drift test gains 3 required fields: `total_live_tools`, `total_live_categories`, `largest_live_categories`
- [x] `cargo test --lib --package termlink-mcp` passes; new test count == 746 + 3 = 749

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.
     Optionally prefix with [RUBBER-STAMP] or [REVIEW] for prioritization.
     Example:
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error
-->

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
cargo test --lib --package termlink-mcp --quiet 2>&1 | tail -3 | grep -q "test result: ok"

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
