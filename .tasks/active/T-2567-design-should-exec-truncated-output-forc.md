# T-2567: DESIGN: should exec truncated output force exit_code=-1 (wire-behavior) + consumer-contract audit

## Context

Filed from T-2468 verb-4 silent-failure review (paired with T-2563, which hardened
the PROVER against this). `executor::execute_capped` (crates/termlink-session/src/executor.rs:216-233)
kills the child on output-cap-hit, sets `truncated=true`, then reports
`exit_code: status.code().unwrap_or(-1)`. The code's OWN comment (executor.rs:24-25)
admits: in the ~64 KiB band around the cap, a truncated result can race to
`exit_code:0` (child already exited 0 before the kill fires). So a consumer running
`exec 'produce_big_output && exit 0'` gets `{exit_code:0, truncated:true}` with
silently-truncated stdout — any consumer that checks only exit_code treats a partial
result as complete success (data loss on the control-terminal verb).

T-2563 made the PROVER assert `truncated != true` so a regression is caught. This
task is the WIRE-BEHAVIOUR question the prover work deferred.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Human
- [ ] [REVIEW] Decide: should `execute_capped` force `exit_code = -1` (or a distinct sentinel)
      whenever `truncated == true`, so exit-code-only consumers cannot mistake a
      truncated capture for success? Trade-off: it changes wire behaviour for any
      caller that currently reads the real code alongside `truncated`.
- [ ] [REVIEW] Consumer-contract audit: enumerate every `exec` / `termlink_run` / `batch_run`
      caller and confirm each checks `truncated` alongside `exit_code` (or would be
      protected by the forced -1). List the unprotected callers.
- [ ] [RUBBER-STAMP] If "force -1" is chosen, file a build task with the code change + a regression
      test; if "keep + document", ensure the truncated-field contract is documented
      at every consumer surface.

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.
-->

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): P-011 runs each command under `set -eo pipefail`.
# `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep matches and closes stdin
# while the upstream is still writing — verification then "fails" even though
# the pattern was present. Safe pattern: capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Or:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Recommendation

**Recommendation:** GO — force `exit_code = -1` whenever `truncated == true` in
`execute_capped`, and file the build task with the regression test.

**Rationale:** `-1` is not a new meaning being introduced here; it is the value
the wire ALREADY produces for this exact case whenever the kill wins the race.
`executor.rs:24-25` says so directly — a caller receiving `exit_code:-1` cannot
tell a cap-hit from a signal kill "both render -1", and in the ~64 KiB band a
truncated result instead reads as `exit_code:0`. So today the same event reports
either `-1` or `0` depending on scheduler timing. Forcing the sentinel removes a
race; it does not add an ambiguity, because `truncated` (T-2537) is already on
the wire to disambiguate `-1` for anyone who cares which kind it was.

**Evidence:** Four `executor::execute` call sites exist —
`termlink-cli/src/commands/execution.rs:76` (CLI `exec`),
`termlink-mcp/src/tools.rs:12618` (`termlink_run`), `tools.rs:15720`
(`batch_run`), `termlink-session/src/handler.rs:508` (`command.execute` RPC).
All four forward `truncated` into their JSON envelope (T-2537 / T-2578), each
pinned by a test. **Zero sites in the workspace branch on `truncated` as a
decision** — grep finds it only being serialized. The single consumer that
actually checks it is `scripts/session-selftest.sh:173-186`, the T-2563 prover.
So the field is universally emitted and, in-tree, universally ignored.

**The unprotected caller documentation cannot reach.** `termlink exec` **text
mode** (`execution.rs:114-124`) prints stdout, prints stderr, and exits with the
raw `exit_code`. It never mentions truncation — there is no field, because there
is no JSON. A shell caller running `termlink exec 'produce_big_output && exit 0'`
receives silently-truncated stdout and exit 0, and no amount of documenting "the
`truncated` contract at every consumer surface" helps, because that surface has
no such field. Under the forced sentinel it exits `-1` and the caller's `set -e`
fires. This is the one argument I think is decisive between the two options.

**What you are actually deciding.**

| Option | Behaviour | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Force `-1` on truncated (recommended) | exit-code-only consumers cannot mistake a partial capture for success; text mode gains a signal it currently cannot have | a caller wanting the child's real code loses it; wire-behaviour change |
| Keep + document | no compat risk | leaves text mode structurally unfixable, and relies on every consumer reading a field that in-tree nobody reads |
| Distinct sentinel (e.g. `-2`) | preserves "-1 means signal" | `-1` already means cap-hit half the time today, so this changes MORE behaviour than forcing `-1`, not less |

**Why I should not decide this.** The blast radius is not measurable from this
repo. In-tree there is no caller reading the real code alongside `truncated`,
but `command.execute` is a published RPC on the charter's founding verb, and
this fleet is documented as running hosts up to ~1000 commits stale (T-2377) —
consumers I cannot enumerate. Whether that unmeasured population outweighs a
demonstrated silent-data-loss path is a sovereignty call, not a code reading.

**Not measured:** any out-of-repo consumer of `command.execute` / `exec --json`;
whether any of them reads `exit_code` without `truncated`.

**If you say GO:** the change is one line at `executor.rs:229`
(`exit_code: if truncated { -1 } else { status.code().unwrap_or(-1) }`), plus a
regression test asserting `truncated → exit_code == -1`, plus the third AC's
build task. `scripts/session-selftest.sh` F3 already covers the prover side.

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
