# T-2940: D2: 57 tasks have waited over 30 days in the human review queue

## Context

`fw audit` FAILs on D2: **57 tasks have waited more than 30 days** in the human review queue, the oldest 132 days (T-1417). The full list is in `.context/audits/arc-008-cycle1-census.md`.

This is a sovereignty-boundary finding, not a code defect. Every one of these tasks is blocked on a human decision the agent is structurally forbidden to make (CLAUDE.md: completing human-owned tasks is not delegated by autonomous mode). The agent cannot clear this queue; only triage can.

The queue's size is itself the finding: a review queue with 57 items aged past a month is one nobody reads, which is the same attention-exhaustion failure the guard layer documents elsewhere (T-2818: a gate that fires wrongly often enough teaches its operator to stop reading it).

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [ ] Finding is reproduced and recorded with the exact audit line, and the remediation command is verified to be the correct one before the human runs it

### Human
- [ ] [REVIEW] Review queue triaged to a readable size
  **Steps:**
    `cd /opt/termlink && .agentic-framework/bin/fw review-queue` to list them with verdicts. For each: close it, re-own it to agent if the remaining work is not actually a human judgement, or explicitly defer it with `revisit_at` set (T-1451/G-053) so it has a structural reminder instead of sitting silent.
  **Expected:** the D2 FAIL either clears or reports a materially smaller count, and every remaining item is one a human genuinely still needs to decide.
  **If not:** if the 57 are mostly mis-owned rather than genuinely pending, that is a separate structural finding about ownership assignment at task creation — file it rather than bulk-reassigning.

## Verification

```bash
test -f .context/audits/arc-008-cycle1-census.md
```

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Recommendation

<!-- T-2945: same shape as inception.md's block — the gate that reads it
     (audit_inception_recommendation, lib/task-audit.sh:117) is shared, so the
     shape is copied rather than reinvented.

     REQUIRED once this task reaches partial-complete: Agent ACs done, at least
     one `### Human` AC still unticked. `lib/review.sh:205-211` (T-2421) BLOCKS
     `fw task review` emission for build/refactor/test/decommission tasks in that
     state with no substantive block here — the operator would otherwise open
     /review/<id> to a blank Recommendation card and be asked to approve a form.

     Not required while every Human AC is ticked or the task has none: the gate
     only fires on the partial-complete transition. It is here from the start so
     you write it while you still have the evidence, not when the gate refuses.

     Format (the parser wants the `**Recommendation:**` line at the start of a
     line; a leading `-` or `*` bullet is also accepted):
     **Recommendation:** GO / NO-GO / DEFER
     **Rationale:** Why (cite evidence — what shipped, what was proven, what remains)
     **Evidence:**
     - Finding 1
     - Finding 2

     DEFER is for evidence gaps, not confidence gaps (CLAUDE.md §Presenting Work
     for Human Review). If the artefact is complete and you still don't want to
     commit, that is a calibration failure — recommend GO or NO-GO.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->

## Updates

### 2026-09-09T17:56:23Z — task-created [task-create-agent]
- **Action:** Created task via task-create agent
- **Output:** /opt/termlink/.tasks/active/T-2940-d2-57-tasks-have-waited-over-30-days-in-.md
- **Context:** Initial task creation
