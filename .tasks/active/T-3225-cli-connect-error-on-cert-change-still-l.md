description: >
  T-2268 (93dc836e5) fixed the MCP side's TLS/TOFU error rendering; the CLI connect
  path (remote.rs:780) still leads with a connectivity guess and buries the cert-change
  cause under 'Caused by'. Low severity; the CLI lags here. Evidence: docs/reports/T-3219-twin-drift-triage.md
  (T-3219).

# T-3225: CLI connect error on cert-change still leads with 'is the hub running?'

## Context
- **Built 2026-09-29 (T-3211 R5).** `render_connect_failure(hub, io::Error)` in remote.rs replaces the unconditional `.context("… is the hub running?")` on the connect in `connect_remote_hub`: TOFU → the TOFU error is the headline; else the exact prior context. Tests `t3225_render_connect_failure_tofu_is_the_headline` (asserts the real `classify_fleet_error` still yields the `tofu clear` hint) and `t3225_render_connect_failure_other_errors_keep_context` (exact headline, cause in `{:#}`, auth cause still classifies as "Secret mismatch"). Pre-fix mutant (`if false`) → TOFU test red. Full CLI suite: run 1 = 1155/1 with an unrelated failure in `dispatch::tests::isolate_rejects_non_git_dir` (passes alone; CWD race without `test_env_lock` → filed **T-3231**); run 2 = 1156/1156, no warnings. P-011 below runs the `remote::` module tests, not the whole binary, so the known flake cannot decide this gate.

<!-- One sentence for small tasks. Link to design docs for substantial ones. -->

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [x] CLI `connect_remote_hub` surfaces a TOFU/cert-change connect failure as its own headline (the `TOFU VIOLATION …` text, which carries the `tofu clear` remediation) instead of "is the hub running?", mirroring MCP `render_connect_error` (T-2268); every other connect failure keeps today's exact context
- [x] Fleet doctor's `classify_fleet_error` still returns the TOFU hint and the auth hint on the new composed messages (no regression of T-1181)
- [x] Pure helper `render_connect_failure` unit-tested for both branches (headline + `{:#}` chain)
- [x] `cargo test -p termlink --bin termlink` passes with no new warnings


## Verification
cargo test -p termlink --bin termlink t3225 > /tmp/.t3225.out 2>&1 && grep -q "2 passed; 0 failed" /tmp/.t3225.out
cargo test -p termlink --bin termlink commands::remote:: > /tmp/.t3225-remote.out 2>&1 && grep -q "test result: ok" /tmp/.t3225-remote.out
grep -q "map_err(|e| render_connect_failure(hub, e))" crates/termlink-cli/src/commands/remote.rs

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# ── Pipefail/SIGPIPE: grepping a command's output (L-387, T-2090, T-2743, T-2738) ──
#
# THE DEFAULT — redirect to a file, then grep the file:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
#     curl -sf "$(bin/fw watchtower url)/page" -o /tmp/.out && grep -q "PAT" /tmp/.out
# Correct at any output size, and `&&` keeps the PRODUCING command's exit code in
# the verdict. Reach for this first; the alternative below is the special case.
#
# NEVER `cmd | grep -q PAT` (L-387) — why: P-011 runs each line under `set -eo
# pipefail`. When grep matches it exits and closes stdin while cmd is still
# writing, cmd takes SIGPIPE, the pipeline exits 141 — verification "fails" with
# the pattern present. Captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863).
#
# THE EXCEPTION — capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Valid ONLY while "$out" fits the 65536-byte pipe buffer, and it is on you to
# know that it does. Above that the form inverts and becomes the very failure
# L-387 describes: echo blocks on the full pipe, grep -q exits, echo takes
# SIGPIPE, rc=141 (T-2743 — measured on a 146,366-byte Watchtower page, 3/3 runs,
# deterministic not racy; rendered routes run 50-200KB, so anything that curls a
# page is over the line). It also discards cmd's exit code, so a 404 yields an
# empty capture that grep merely fails to match rather than a failed line.
# If you do use it: single pipe only, no intermediate tail/awk/sed stage between
# capture and grep (T-2090) — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its stdin
# on, and grep scans the whole captured string anyway, so the `tail -3` was
# cosmetic. `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`, nothing between.
#
# ── Asserting an ABSENCE: prove the search could have succeeded (T-3144) ──
#
# `! grep -q "PATTERN" file` exits 0 when the pattern is absent. It ALSO exits 0
# when the file was renamed, deleted, or is empty — so the leg cannot distinguish
# "the bad thing is not there" from "I could not look", and the gate reports green
# over a check that never ran. Pair every absence assertion with something that
# fails if the search could not happen:
#
#     test -f path/to/file && ! grep -q "PATTERN" path/to/file    # existence first
#     grep -q "KNOWN_MARKER" f && ! grep -q "PATTERN" f           # positive companion
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && ! grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out       # &&-joined producer
#
# Count-equals-zero is the same defect wearing a different hat, and it is the one
# that bites hardest over a COMMAND's output rather than a file:
#
#     [ "$(cargo clippy --workspace 2>&1 | grep -c "^error")" = "0" ]   # WRONG
#
# If cargo is missing, or dies before emitting diagnostics, there are no `^error`
# lines, the count is 0, and the leg passes — a build gate that goes green
# precisely when the build could not run. Measured in this corpus, not invented.
# Keep the producer's exit code in the verdict:
#
#     cargo clippy --workspace > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && ! grep -q "^error" /tmp/.out
#
# T-3144 censused 2853 task files: 71 absence assertions, 41 already correct, 30
# not. The convention mostly works — this note is here so the next one is written
# right, because a vacuous leg is invisible until the day the path moves.
#
# TEST RUNNERS need a guard either way (T-2738). `set -e` is suppressed inside the
# `if` condition the gate runs each line in, so in `cmd1; cmd2` only cmd2 is the
# verdict — and the pass marker you grep for survives a partial failure: a suite
# printing "3 failed, 9 passed" satisfies `grep -q "9 passed"`, and generalising
# to `grep -qE "[0-9]+ passed"` matches the same output. Keep the exit code:
#     python3 -m pytest <file> -q > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q passed /tmp/.out
# or add the guard the exit code used to supply:
#     out=$(python3 -m pytest <file> -q 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q passed && ! echo "$out" | grep -q failed
#     out=$(bats <file> 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q '^ok 1 ' && ! echo "$out" | grep -q '^not ok'
# The close gate refuses the unguarded form. Bypass: FW_ALLOW_UNJUDGED_TEST_RUN=1.
#
# REHEARSING A LINE BY HAND DOES NOT REHEARSE THE GATE (T-2743). Your interactive
# shell has no `set -eo pipefail`. A line has returned 0 by hand and 141 under
# P-011, from the same directory, the same second. To rehearse for real:
#     bash -c 'set -eo pipefail; <your verification line>'
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

## RCA
**Symptom:** A CLI cross-hub connect that failed because the hub's TLS certificate changed (TOFU violation) reported "Cannot connect to <hub> — is the hub running?", with the real cause only in anyhow's "Caused by" chain. The operator was pointed at connectivity for a hub that was up.
**Root cause:** `connect_remote_hub` (remote.rs) wrapped EVERY `connect_addr_with_timeout` error in one fixed `.context("… is the hub running?")`, so no failure class could have its own headline. T-2268 fixed exactly this on the MCP twin (`render_connect_error`) and never ported it to the CLI.
**Why structurally allowed:** MCP/CLI twins are maintained by duplication (T-2069 convention) with nothing checking that a fix to one reaches the other. Fleet doctor masked it partially: T-1181 made `classify_fleet_error` read the `{:#}` chain, so `fleet doctor` showed the right hint while every other CLI remote verb kept the misleading headline.
**Prevention:** Unit tests pin both branches of `render_connect_failure` and assert the real `classify_fleet_error` still classifies the composed messages (pre-fix mutant is red). The class-level detector is T-2999's `scripts/check-mcp-cli-twin-drift.sh`, which is how this instance was found (T-3219 triage row 93dc836e5).
## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Recommendation

<!-- T-2945: same shape as inception.md's block — the gate that reads it
     (audit_inception_recommendation, lib/task-audit.sh:117) is shared, so the
     shape is copied rather than reinvented.

     REQUIRED once this task reaches partial-complete: Agent ACs done, at least
     one `### Human` AC still unticked. `lib/review.sh:205-211` (T-2421) BLOCKS
     `fw task review` emission for build/refactor/test/decommission tasks in that
     state with no substantive block here — the operator would otherwise open
     /review/<id> to a blank Recommendation card and be asked to approve a form.

     Not required while every Human AC is ticked or the task has none: the gate
     only fires on the partial-complete transition. It is here from the start so
     you write it while you still have the evidence, not when the gate refuses.

     Format (the parser wants the `**Recommendation:**` line at the start of a
     line; a leading `-` or `*` bullet is also accepted):
     **Recommendation:** GO / NO-GO / DEFER
     **Rationale:** Why (cite evidence — what shipped, what was proven, what remains)
     **Evidence:**
     - Finding 1
     - Finding 2

     DEFER is for evidence gaps, not confidence gaps (CLAUDE.md §Presenting Work
     for Human Review). If the artefact is complete and you still don't want to
     commit, that is a calibration failure — recommend GO or NO-GO.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
