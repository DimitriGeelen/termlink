# T-3010: Set 90-day revisit_at on artifact.* surface decision

## Context

Value-review C-29 (docs/reports/VALUE-REVIEW-repo-2026-09-19-consolidated.md line 58):
`artifact.get`/`put` is fully wired (hub + CLI + MCP) but measured at zero calls in
34.2 days. The review's own recommendation was INVESTIGATE, not DELETE — "extend
window to 90+ days before any verdict; no code action" — because a short sample is
not enough evidence to remove a built capability (Directive #2: no premature,
unverified action). T-3010 was filed (S-29h in the review's task table) specifically
to be the structural carrier of that 90-day reminder, since without one the finding
would sit unread in a report until someone happened to re-read it. There is no other
existing task or concerns.yaml entry recording this deferral.

The deliverable is the frontmatter fields above (`revisit_at`, `revisit_evidence_needed`)
plus this note — not a code change. `agents/context/revisit-due-scan.sh` (T-1452/G-053)
scans every file under `.tasks/active/` for a ripe `revisit_at`, independent of
`workflow_type`, so this works as a build-type task exactly as it would on an
inception. **This task intentionally stays open (not `work-completed`)** — closing
it would move the file to `.tasks/completed/`, which the daily scan does not read,
silently defeating the reminder it exists to carry. It is expected to sit dormant
in `active/` until 2026-12-18, at which point the daily G-053 scan will surface it
(`.context/working/.revisits-due.txt`) for whoever is on session then to re-measure
call volume and decide.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [x] `revisit_at` set to a valid ISO date ≥90 days after the 2026-09-19 C-29 measurement
- [x] `revisit_evidence_needed` states exactly what re-check resolves the deferral
- [x] Task recorded as intentionally-open (not completed) so `.tasks/active/`-only
      scan (`revisit-due-scan.sh`) can still find it on the revisit date

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX > /tmp/.rev 2>&1 && grep -q "Overall:.*PASS" /tmp/.rev`
       added to ## Verification. NEVER `... 2>&1 | grep -q ...` — that is the shape the
       Pipefail/SIGPIPE section below forbids, and this line used to prescribe it.
-->

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# ── Pipefail/SIGPIPE: grepping a command's output (L-387, T-2090, T-2743, T-2738) ──
#
# THE DEFAULT — redirect to a file, then grep the file:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
#     curl -sf "$(bin/fw watchtower url)/page" -o /tmp/.out && grep -q "PAT" /tmp/.out
# Correct at any output size, and `&&` keeps the PRODUCING command's exit code in
# the verdict. Reach for this first; the alternative below is the special case.
#
# NEVER `cmd | grep -q PAT` (L-387) — why: P-011 runs each line under `set -eo
# pipefail`. When grep matches it exits and closes stdin while cmd is still
# writing, cmd takes SIGPIPE, the pipeline exits 141 — verification "fails" with
# the pattern present. Captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863).
#
# THE EXCEPTION — capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Valid ONLY while "$out" fits the 65536-byte pipe buffer, and it is on you to
# know that it does. Above that the form inverts and becomes the very failure
# L-387 describes: echo blocks on the full pipe, grep -q exits, echo takes
# SIGPIPE, rc=141 (T-2743 — measured on a 146,366-byte Watchtower page, 3/3 runs,
# deterministic not racy; rendered routes run 50-200KB, so anything that curls a
# page is over the line). It also discards cmd's exit code, so a 404 yields an
# empty capture that grep merely fails to match rather than a failed line.
# If you do use it: single pipe only, no intermediate tail/awk/sed stage between
# capture and grep (T-2090) — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its stdin
# on, and grep scans the whole captured string anyway, so the `tail -3` was
# cosmetic. `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`, nothing between.
#
# TEST RUNNERS need a guard either way (T-2738). `set -e` is suppressed inside the
# `if` condition the gate runs each line in, so in `cmd1; cmd2` only cmd2 is the
# verdict — and the pass marker you grep for survives a partial failure: a suite
# printing "3 failed, 9 passed" satisfies `grep -q "9 passed"`, and generalising
# to `grep -qE "[0-9]+ passed"` matches the same output. Keep the exit code:
#     python3 -m pytest <file> -q > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q passed /tmp/.out
# or add the guard the exit code used to supply:
#     out=$(python3 -m pytest <file> -q 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q passed && ! echo "$out" | grep -q failed
#     out=$(bats <file> 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q '^ok 1 ' && ! echo "$out" | grep -q '^not ok'
# The close gate refuses the unguarded form. Bypass: FW_ALLOW_UNJUDGED_TEST_RUN=1.
#
# REHEARSING A LINE BY HAND DOES NOT REHEARSE THE GATE (T-2743). Your interactive
# shell has no `set -eo pipefail`. A line has returned 0 by hand and 141 under
# P-011, from the same directory, the same second. To rehearse for real:
#     bash -c 'set -eo pipefail; <your verification line>'
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Recommendation

<!-- T-2945: same shape as inception.md's block — the gate that reads it
     (audit_inception_recommendation, lib/task-audit.sh:117) is shared, so the
     shape is copied rather than reinvented.

     REQUIRED once this task reaches partial-complete: Agent ACs done, at least
     one `### Human` AC still unticked. `lib/review.sh:205-211` (T-2421) BLOCKS
     `fw task review` emission for build/refactor/test/decommission tasks in that
     state with no substantive block here — the operator would otherwise open
     /review/<id> to a blank Recommendation card and be asked to approve a form.

     Not required while every Human AC is ticked or the task has none: the gate
     only fires on the partial-complete transition. It is here from the start so
     you write it while you still have the evidence, not when the gate refuses.

     Format (the parser wants the `**Recommendation:**` line at the start of a
     line; a leading `-` or `*` bullet is also accepted):
     **Recommendation:** GO / NO-GO / DEFER
     **Rationale:** Why (cite evidence — what shipped, what was proven, what remains)
     **Evidence:**
     - Finding 1
     - Finding 2

     DEFER is for evidence gaps, not confidence gaps (CLAUDE.md §Presenting Work
     for Human Review). If the artefact is complete and you still don't want to
     commit, that is a calibration failure — recommend GO or NO-GO.
-->

## Decisions

### 2026-09-25 — Where the revisit reminder lives, and whether to close this task
- **Chose:** Set `revisit_at`/`revisit_evidence_needed` directly on T-3010's own
  frontmatter and leave the task open in `.tasks/active/` (status `started-work`,
  not `work-completed`).
- **Why:** `revisit-due-scan.sh` only scans `.tasks/active/*.md`; closing the task
  would move it to `completed/` and silently defeat the reminder. T-3010 is already
  the task the value-review filed specifically to carry this deferral (S-29h/C-29),
  so there is no separate "real" decision task to attach the fields to instead.
- **Rejected:** Registering a new `concerns.yaml` entry with its own revisit
  mechanism — rejected because no such mechanism exists for `concerns.yaml` entries
  today (only tasks are scanned), and inventing one would be new-tooling scope well
  beyond a 90-day-reminder task.

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
