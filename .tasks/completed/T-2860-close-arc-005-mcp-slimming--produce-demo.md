# T-2860: Close arc-005 mcp-slimming — produce demo evidence and route closure to approval

## Context

arc-005 (mcp-slimming) has had **both** constituent tasks — T-2406 and T-2407 — at
`work-completed` since 2026-07-11, while the arc itself has stayed `in-progress` and
fired a stale-arc audit WARN on 5 consecutive audits. The work was finished; what was
missing was the **demo evidence** that `fw arc close` requires (`--demo` is mandatory
per §ACD/G-062), so nobody could close it and the WARN kept recurring.

This task produces that evidence and routes closure to the human. It deliberately does
**not** close the arc: `fw arc close` is agent-refused under `$CLAUDECODE=1`, and the
three §ACD completion questions are a human judgment.

**Evidence:** `docs/reports/arc-005-close-evidence.md`.

Written against **PL-245** — arc-004 was recorded closed=shipped and "live-verified" on
loopback-only evidence. The headline mechanic here makes two claims (slimmer descriptions
fleet-wide; fewer malformed-argument retries) and only the first is demonstrated. The
evidence doc separates them explicitly rather than letting a measured half carry an
unmeasured one, and it also corrects the naive byte total: of the 51,009 bytes now
missing from the catalog, **44,206 are this arc's trimming** and 6,803 come from
unrelated P4 tool removals.

Not in scope: instrumenting a malformed-argument retry counter (§4 of the evidence doc
names it as what would settle the second claim), and re-measuring `.141`, which is down.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [x] **Both constituent tasks confirmed complete.** `fw arc show arc-005` lists T-2406 and T-2407, and both carry `status: work-completed` — the arc is blocked on closure paperwork, not on unfinished work.
- [x] **Byte-level trim measured against the arc-start baseline.** `scripts/test-mcp-desc-budget.sh --report-only` exits 0 and reports current tools / total bytes / max single, compared in the evidence doc against the arc's recorded 273 tools / 156,525 bytes / 11,751 max.
- [x] **Anti-regrowth guard proven load-bearing, not merely present.** The evidence doc records that the guard FAILS when the ceiling is set below the measured max (demonstrated by running it with a lowered ceiling), so a passing run is evidence rather than a vacuous check.
- [x] **Shipped-vs-live checked for the fleet half of the headline mechanic (PL-245).** The evidence doc records, per reachable hub, whether it serves a binary new enough to carry the trimmed catalog — and states plainly which hubs do NOT, rather than asserting fleet-wide delivery from a local measurement.
- [x] **Unproven half of the headline mechanic named, not glossed.** The evidence doc states explicitly that the "fewer malformed-argument retries" clause is NOT measured, and says what evidence would settle it — so the human approves against a truthful account of what was and was not demonstrated.
- [x] **Closure routed to the human, not self-stamped.** `fw arc review arc-005` is run and the resulting Watchtower approval URL is surfaced to the operator; no `fw arc close` is executed by the agent.

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX > /tmp/.rev 2>&1 && grep -q "Overall:.*PASS" /tmp/.rev`
       added to ## Verification. NEVER `... 2>&1 | grep -q ...` — that is the shape the
       Pipefail/SIGPIPE section below forbids, and this line used to prescribe it.
-->

## Verification

# Both constituent tasks are complete — the arc is blocked on paperwork, not work
grep -q "work-completed" .tasks/completed/T-2406-arc-mcp-slimming-s1--trimming-policy--an.md && grep -q "work-completed" .tasks/completed/T-2407-arc-mcp-slimming-s2--trim-the-600-1000-c.md
# The budget guard runs and reports the current measurement
bash scripts/test-mcp-desc-budget.sh --report-only > /tmp/.t2860-budget.out 2>&1 && grep -q "total bytes" /tmp/.t2860-budget.out
# The guard is load-bearing: lowering the ceiling below the measured max makes it FAIL
! MAX_DESC_CEILING=1000 bash scripts/test-mcp-desc-budget.sh > /tmp/.t2860-mut.out 2>&1
# Evidence doc satisfies the arc-close demo gate (exists, >=256 bytes, references the arc)
test -f docs/reports/arc-005-close-evidence.md && test "$(wc -c < docs/reports/arc-005-close-evidence.md)" -ge 256
grep -q "arc-005" docs/reports/arc-005-close-evidence.md
# The unmeasured half of the headline mechanic is named, not glossed
grep -q "NOT MEASURED" docs/reports/arc-005-close-evidence.md
# The approval page actually renders the closure form the operator must submit
curl -sf "$(cat .context/working/watchtower.url)/arcs/mcp-slimming/close" -o /tmp/.t2860-page.out && grep -q "Demo evidence" /tmp/.t2860-page.out

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# ── Pipefail/SIGPIPE: grepping a command's output (L-387, T-2090, T-2743, T-2738) ──
#
# THE DEFAULT — redirect to a file, then grep the file:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
#     curl -sf "$(bin/fw watchtower url)/page" -o /tmp/.out && grep -q "PAT" /tmp/.out
# Correct at any output size, and `&&` keeps the PRODUCING command's exit code in
# the verdict. Reach for this first; the alternative below is the special case.
#
# NEVER `cmd | grep -q PAT` (L-387) — why: P-011 runs each line under `set -eo
# pipefail`. When grep matches it exits and closes stdin while cmd is still
# writing, cmd takes SIGPIPE, the pipeline exits 141 — verification "fails" with
# the pattern present. Captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863).
#
# THE EXCEPTION — capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Valid ONLY while "$out" fits the 65536-byte pipe buffer, and it is on you to
# know that it does. Above that the form inverts and becomes the very failure
# L-387 describes: echo blocks on the full pipe, grep -q exits, echo takes
# SIGPIPE, rc=141 (T-2743 — measured on a 146,366-byte Watchtower page, 3/3 runs,
# deterministic not racy; rendered routes run 50-200KB, so anything that curls a
# page is over the line). It also discards cmd's exit code, so a 404 yields an
# empty capture that grep merely fails to match rather than a failed line.
# If you do use it: single pipe only, no intermediate tail/awk/sed stage between
# capture and grep (T-2090) — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its stdin
# on, and grep scans the whole captured string anyway, so the `tail -3` was
# cosmetic. `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`, nothing between.
#
# TEST RUNNERS need a guard either way (T-2738). `set -e` is suppressed inside the
# `if` condition the gate runs each line in, so in `cmd1; cmd2` only cmd2 is the
# verdict — and the pass marker you grep for survives a partial failure: a suite
# printing "3 failed, 9 passed" satisfies `grep -q "9 passed"`, and generalising
# to `grep -qE "[0-9]+ passed"` matches the same output. Keep the exit code:
#     python3 -m pytest <file> -q > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q passed /tmp/.out
# or add the guard the exit code used to supply:
#     out=$(python3 -m pytest <file> -q 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q passed && ! echo "$out" | grep -q failed
#     out=$(bats <file> 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q '^ok 1 ' && ! echo "$out" | grep -q '^not ok'
# The close gate refuses the unguarded form. Bypass: FW_ALLOW_UNJUDGED_TEST_RUN=1.
#
# REHEARSING A LINE BY HAND DOES NOT REHEARSE THE GATE (T-2743). Your interactive
# shell has no `set -eo pipefail`. A line has returned 0 by hand and 141 under
# P-011, from the same directory, the same second. To rehearse for real:
#     bash -c 'set -eo pipefail; <your verification line>'
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Recommendation

<!-- T-2945: same shape as inception.md's block — the gate that reads it
     (audit_inception_recommendation, lib/task-audit.sh:117) is shared, so the
     shape is copied rather than reinvented.

     REQUIRED once this task reaches partial-complete: Agent ACs done, at least
     one `### Human` AC still unticked. `lib/review.sh:205-211` (T-2421) BLOCKS
     `fw task review` emission for build/refactor/test/decommission tasks in that
     state with no substantive block here — the operator would otherwise open
     /review/<id> to a blank Recommendation card and be asked to approve a form.

     Not required while every Human AC is ticked or the task has none: the gate
     only fires on the partial-complete transition. It is here from the start so
     you write it while you still have the evidence, not when the gate refuses.

     Format (the parser wants the `**Recommendation:**` line at the start of a
     line; a leading `-` or `*` bullet is also accepted):
     **Recommendation:** GO / NO-GO / DEFER
     **Rationale:** Why (cite evidence — what shipped, what was proven, what remains)
     **Evidence:**
     - Finding 1
     - Finding 2

     DEFER is for evidence gaps, not confidence gaps (CLAUDE.md §Presenting Work
     for Human Review). If the artefact is complete and you still don't want to
     commit, that is a calibration failure — recommend GO or NO-GO.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
