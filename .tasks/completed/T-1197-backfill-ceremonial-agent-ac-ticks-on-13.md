# T-1197: Backfill ceremonial Agent AC ticks on 13 work-completed inceptions (post-T-1194 cleanup)

## Context

<!-- One sentence for small tasks. Link to design docs for substantial ones. -->

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [x] Identify all inception tasks with `## Recommendation` present and unticked ceremonial Agent ACs (13 candidates initially, 12 touched after guard)
- [x] Apply `tick_inception_decide_acs` (T-1194-patched) to each — idempotent. Touched: T-909, T-930, T-940, T-947, T-950, T-952, T-953, T-956, T-957, T-959, T-967, T-972 (each: 3/3 ceremonial Agent ACs ticked)
- [x] Verify: `fw audit` now reports `[PASS] CTL-012: All 825 completed tasks have checked ACs`
- [x] Commit backfill with N-file summary

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.
     Optionally prefix with [RUBBER-STAMP] or [REVIEW] for prioritization.
     Example:
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error
-->

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
