# T-687: Add --json flag to hub start for structured startup output

## Context

<!-- One sentence for small tasks. Link to design docs for substantial ones. -->

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [x] `--json` flag added to `HubAction::Start` in cli.rs
- [x] `json` param threaded through main.rs dispatch to cmd_hub_start
- [x] JSON startup output emitted (socket, pidfile, tcp, pid, secret_file, tls_cert)
- [x] Suppresses human-readable text in JSON mode
- [x] Project compiles cleanly

## Verification

<!-- Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
     Lines starting with # are comments. Empty lines ignored.
     The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
     Examples:
       python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('path/to/file.yaml'))"
       curl -sf http://localhost:3000/page
       grep -q "expected_string" output_file.txt
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
