# T-804: Update docs with session improvements

## Context

Update CHANGELOG and docs with improvements from this session: event.subscribe next_seq, dispatch created_at fix, shell_escape dedup, new tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [x] CHANGELOG.md mentions event.subscribe next_seq and dispatch created_at fix
- [x] Test count in docs is accurate (675)

## Verification

grep -q "next_seq" CHANGELOG.md
grep -q "675" CHANGELOG.md

## Updates
### Not applicable
<!-- Deleted Human AC section.
     Optionally prefix with [RUBBER-STAMP] or [REVIEW] for prioritization.
     Example:
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error
-->

## Verification

<!-- Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
     Lines starting with # are comments. Empty lines ignored.
     The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
     Examples:
       python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('path/to/file.yaml'))"
       curl -sf http://localhost:3000/page
       grep -q "expected_string" output_file.txt
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->
