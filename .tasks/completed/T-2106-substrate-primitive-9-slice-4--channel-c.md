# T-2106: substrate primitive 9 slice 4 — channel cv-keys operator inspection verb (read-only)

## Context

Substrate primitive #9 (broadcast-with-replay) — operator inspection verb.

Slices 1-3 (T-2103/T-2104/T-2105) shipped the RPC-tier + CLI/MCP for the
SUBSCRIBE side: `channel subscribe --include-current-value` lets a late-joiner
fetch the per-cv_key snapshot inline with the message stream.

This slice adds the READ-ONLY OPERATOR surface: `termlink channel cv-keys
<TOPIC>` answers "what cv_keys are currently advertising on this topic, and
at what offsets?" without making the operator subscribe just to inspect.

Pattern parity with `termlink channel claims-summary` (T-2042) — read-only
hub introspection for a substrate primitive. Mirror of `cv_index::current_values()`
exposed via JSON-RPC + CLI + MCP.

Use cases:
- Heartbeat producers (T-2107 slice 5) wire `cv_key=<agent_id>` — operator
  inspects to see who's actively advertising
- Stale/dropped cv_keys diagnosis (cv_index is process-local, no persistence)
- Cap-overflow diagnosis (per-topic 1000 limit + env override)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [x] New protocol method `CHANNEL_CV_KEYS = "channel.cv_keys"` in `crates/termlink-protocol/src/control.rs`
- [x] Hub handler `handle_channel_cv_keys` validates topic exists, returns `{ok, topic, count, entries: [{cv_key, offset}, ...]}` sorted by cv_key
- [x] Returns `CHANNEL_TOPIC_UNKNOWN` (-32013) for missing topic (mirror of subscribe/post error shape)
- [x] CLI subcommand `termlink channel cv-keys <TOPIC> [--hub <ADDR>] [--json]` in `cli.rs` + dispatch in `main.rs`
- [x] `cmd_channel_cv_keys` calls the RPC, renders `<cv_key> -> @<offset>` per entry or `{ok, topic, count, entries: [...]}` JSON
- [x] Empty cv_index path: human mode prints `no cv_keys recorded on topic <name>` (not silent zero); JSON returns `count: 0, entries: []`
- [x] MCP tool `termlink_channel_cv_keys` with `topic: String` param + read-only semantics
- [x] Unit test in `crates/termlink-hub/src/channel.rs` covering: empty topic, single cv_key, multi cv_key (sorted), unknown topic → error
- [x] `cargo build -p termlink -p termlink-mcp -p termlink-hub` succeeds
- [x] `cargo test -p termlink-hub` 351/351 passes (existing 347 + 4 new cv_keys tests)
- [x] Sidecar smoke: cv-tagged posts → cv-keys returns 2 entries (alice@2 = last-write-wins over alice@0, bob@1), untagged correctly excluded; JSON shape verified; empty topic loud-empty; unknown topic returns -32013

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.

## Verification

cargo build -p termlink -p termlink-mcp -p termlink-hub --tests 2>&1 | tail -3
out=$(cargo test -p termlink-hub --lib 2>&1 | tail -3); echo "$out" | grep -q "test result: ok"
grep -q 'CHANNEL_CV_KEYS' crates/termlink-protocol/src/control.rs
grep -q 'cv-keys\|CvKeys' crates/termlink-cli/src/cli.rs
grep -q 'termlink_channel_cv_keys\|channel_cv_keys' crates/termlink-mcp/src/tools.rs
grep -qE 'fn handle_channel_cv_keys|cv_keys' crates/termlink-hub/src/channel.rs

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): P-011 runs each command under `set -eo pipefail`.
# `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep matches and closes stdin
# while the upstream is still writing — verification then "fails" even though
# the pattern was present. Safe pattern: capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Or:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
