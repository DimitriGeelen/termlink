# T-708: Add --json flag to agent negotiate command for structured output

## Context

<!-- One sentence for small tasks. Link to design docs for substantial ones. -->

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [x] `--json` flag added to AgentAction::Negotiate in cli.rs
- [x] Flag wired through main.rs to cmd_agent_negotiate
- [x] JSON mode suppresses progress eprintln and outputs structured result
- [x] Error paths output JSON errors when --json is set
- [x] `cargo build --release` succeeds

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.
     Optionally prefix with [RUBBER-STAMP] or [REVIEW] for prioritization.
     Example:
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error
-->

## Verification

cargo build --release 2>&1 | tail -1
termlink agent negotiate --help 2>&1 | grep -q '\-\-json'

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
