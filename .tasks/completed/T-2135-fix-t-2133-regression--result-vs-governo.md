# T-2135: Fix T-2133 regression — .result vs .governor envelope shape

## Context

T-2133 (PL-206 layer c) swapped fictional `termlink remote call local
hub.governor_status` for the real `termlink hub status --governor --json`
in 5 documents. PL-206 layer-c lint validates verb existence, so the swap
landed clean on the lint.

BUT — the two surfaces wrap their response differently:
- **Raw RPC** (`socat ... hub.governor_status`) wraps in `.result`
  per JSON-RPC convention
- **CLI** (`hub status --governor --json`) wraps in `.governor` per
  T-2060's chosen shape

I missed updating the downstream jq selectors that consumed the old
shape. Two docs ship the regression:
- `substrate-governor.md:414`: `jq .result.capacity_hits_total` →
  should be `.governor.capacity_hits_total`
- `substrate-offline-queue-recipe.md:89`: `jq '.result | {dedupe_hits_total,
  dedupe_entries_active}'` → should be `.governor | {...}`

This is precisely the case the PL-206 T-2134 RCA predicted would need
a "future layer-c2 lint" — jq field references against actual response
shapes. The current lint can't catch this class.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
- [x] Both `.result.X` → `.governor.X` regressions fixed in their files
- [x] No remaining `jq .result.` or `jq '.result |` patterns in `docs/operations/substrate-*.md`
- [x] PL-206 layer-c lint reports clean
- [x] PL-206 layer-b lint reports clean
- [x] Comment in `substrate-post-idempotency.md` about "same envelope shape" corrected (the shapes are actually DIFFERENT — CLI wraps in `.governor`, RPC wraps in `.result`)

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX 2>&1 | grep -q "Overall:.*PASS"` added to ## Verification.

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# Pipefail/SIGPIPE hint (L-387): P-011 runs each command under `set -eo pipefail`.
# `cmd | grep -q PATTERN` exits 141 (SIGPIPE) when grep matches and closes stdin
# while the upstream is still writing — verification then "fails" even though
# the pattern was present. Safe pattern: capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Or:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
# Origin: L-387, captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863) before this hint.
#
# Single pipe only — no intermediate tail/awk/sed stages between capture and grep
# (T-2090): `echo "$out" | tail -3 | grep -q PAT` re-introduces the SIGPIPE risk
# the capture step closed off — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its
# stdin on. `echo "$out"` is small and immediate; grep scans the whole captured
# string anyway, so the tail-3 was cosmetic. Drop it: `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`.
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

## RCA

**Symptom:** Two recipes in substrate ops docs had jq selectors reading
`.result.capacity_hits_total` / `.result | {dedupe_hits_total, ...}` —
fields that don't exist when piped from `hub status --governor --json`.
The pipeline silently outputs `null` for the missing field; the operator
sees `null` instead of a number and has no diagnostic.

**Root cause:** When T-2133 swapped fictional `termlink remote call
local hub.governor_status` (raw JSON-RPC, wraps response in `.result`)
for the real `termlink hub status --governor --json` (CLI, wraps in
`.governor`), I focused on verb correctness and missed the envelope
shape difference. The PL-206 layer-c lint validated the verb swap as
clean — it doesn't know about jq field selectors.

**Why structurally allowed:** PL-206 layer-c lint covers verb existence
in fenced bash blocks. It is intentionally NOT aware of:
- Response struct field shapes (would need source struct introspection
  or a live test harness)
- Cross-stage pipeline correctness (would need fenced-block execution)
- jq selectors against `--json` outputs

T-2134's RCA already named this exact gap as the "future layer-c2 lint":
"Extend the doc-CLI lint to also validate JSON field references against
the actual response struct." T-2135 is the FIRST observable instance
where that gap actually bit (the predicted regression class arriving
within 2 commits of T-2134).

**Prevention:**
- **(applicable now)** Manual sweep landed: I grepped every substrate
  doc for `jq \.result\.` and `jq '\.result \|` after the fix; no
  matches remain.
- **(future layer-c2 lint)** Expand `scripts/lint-doc-fenced-bash.sh`
  or add a sibling that:
  1. Walks fenced bash blocks
  2. Identifies every `termlink <verb> ... --json | jq <selector>` pair
  3. Spawns a test hub OR introspects the source struct
  4. Asserts each top-level selector field exists in the response
  For now this is deferred; the manual sweep is the operative coverage.
- **(future doc-smoke harness)** PL-206 layer (c2 full): execute fenced
  bash against a throwaway hub. Would catch ALL such regressions structurally.

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
