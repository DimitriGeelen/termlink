name: "rust-analyzer LSP crashes because the rustup component was never installed"
description: >
  T-3055 measured the rust-analyzer-lsp plugin enabled and crashing: an LSP workspaceSymbol
  call returns 'rust-analyzer crashed with exit code 1'. Root cause found first-hypothesis:
  /root/.cargo/bin/rust-analyzer exists on PATH but is a rustup SHIM, and rustup component
  list --installed shows cargo, clippy, rust-docs, rust-std, rustc, rustfmt and NO
  rust-analyzer. Running it directly prints: error: Unknown binary 'rust-analyzer'
  in official toolchain 'stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu'. So the plugin was never
  at fault - the toolchain component behind it is absent, and the shim's non-zero
  exit is what the LSP host reports as a crash. This matters because the repo is 7
  Rust crates and the plugin costs ~0 tokens (out-of-process, no model context per
  claude plugin details), so code intelligence here is pure upside that has simply
  never worked. Deliverable: install the component and prove the LSP actually answers
  a query, not merely that the binary runs.

# T-3056: rust-analyzer LSP crashes because the rustup component was never installed

## Context

<!-- One sentence for small tasks. Link to design docs for substantial ones. -->

## Acceptance Criteria

### Agent
<!-- Criteria the agent can verify (code, tests, commands). P-010 gates on these. -->
- [x] The `rust-analyzer` rustup component is installed: it appears in
      `rustup component list --installed`, which it did not before
- [x] `rust-analyzer --version` prints a real version instead of
      `error: Unknown binary 'rust-analyzer' in official toolchain` — the shim now
      resolves to an actual binary
- [x] The LSP ANSWERS A QUERY against this repo's Rust source, not merely starts. A
      binary that runs is not code intelligence that works — the failing symptom was an
      LSP call, so the proof has to be an LSP call
- [x] Satisfies the operator's standalone constraint, recorded: the component is a local
      binary with no external service dependency, commercial or otherwise, and
      `claude plugin details` reports ~0 always-on token cost (out-of-process)

### Human
<!-- Criteria requiring human verification (UI/UX, subjective quality). Not blocking.
     Remove this section if all criteria are agent-verifiable.
     Each criterion MUST include Steps/Expected/If-not so the human can act without guessing.

     ── Prefix routing (T-1811, T-1878): default to [REVIEWER] if Expected is grep-able ──
     If your Expected clause is grep-able / file-exists / structural (a deterministic
     shell check), prefer [REVIEWER] — that AC should be an Agent AC with the reviewer
     command in `## Verification` instead of a Human AC here. Only keep [REVIEW] if
     verification genuinely needs human taste (tone, feel, layout rhythm).
     See CLAUDE.md §AC Classification Guidance for the conversion rule.

     [REVIEW] example (genuine human judgment):
       - [ ] [REVIEW] Dashboard renders correctly
         **Steps:**
         1. Open https://example.com/dashboard in browser
         2. Verify all panels load within 2 seconds
         3. Check browser console for errors
         **Expected:** All panels visible, no console errors
         **If not:** Screenshot the broken panel and note the console error

     [REVIEWER] example (static-scan-verifiable — convert to Agent AC + Verification):
       - [ ] [REVIEWER] Block message names both bypass mechanisms
         **Steps:**
         1. Run `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX`
         **Expected:** Verdict: PASS; no findings on `block-message-completeness`
         **If not:** Inspect hook block-message string and add missing mechanism
       Conversion: this AC should be moved to ### Agent and
       `bin/fw reviewer T-XXX > /tmp/.rev 2>&1 && grep -q "Overall:.*PASS" /tmp/.rev`
       added to ## Verification. NEVER `... 2>&1 | grep -q ...` — that is the shape the
       Pipefail/SIGPIPE section below forbids, and this line used to prescribe it.
-->

## Verification

# Shell commands that MUST pass before work-completed. One per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments (skipped). Empty lines ignored.
# The completion gate runs each command — if any exits non-zero, completion is blocked.
#
# Toolchain hint (L-291): if you edited *.vbproj/*.csproj/*.xaml add `dotnet build`;
# *.go → `go build ./...`; Cargo.toml → `cargo check`; tsconfig.json → `tsc --noEmit`;
# pom.xml → `mvn -q compile`. P-011 runs only what you write — broken builds slip
# past otherwise (origin: 003-NTB-ATC-Plugin T-077, broken WPF DLL on master 5 days).
#
# ── Pipefail/SIGPIPE: grepping a command's output (L-387, T-2090, T-2743, T-2738) ──
#
# THE DEFAULT — redirect to a file, then grep the file:
#     cmd > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q "PATTERN" /tmp/.out
#     curl -sf "$(bin/fw watchtower url)/page" -o /tmp/.out && grep -q "PAT" /tmp/.out
# Correct at any output size, and `&&` keeps the PRODUCING command's exit code in
# the verdict. Reach for this first; the alternative below is the special case.
#
# NEVER `cmd | grep -q PAT` (L-387) — why: P-011 runs each line under `set -eo
# pipefail`. When grep matches it exits and closes stdin while cmd is still
# writing, cmd takes SIGPIPE, the pipeline exits 141 — verification "fails" with
# the pattern present. Captured 4× (T-1716, T-1838, T-1862, T-1863).
#
# THE EXCEPTION — capture first, grep the capture:
#     out=$(cmd 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q "PATTERN"
# Valid ONLY while "$out" fits the 65536-byte pipe buffer, and it is on you to
# know that it does. Above that the form inverts and becomes the very failure
# L-387 describes: echo blocks on the full pipe, grep -q exits, echo takes
# SIGPIPE, rc=141 (T-2743 — measured on a 146,366-byte Watchtower page, 3/3 runs,
# deterministic not racy; rendered routes run 50-200KB, so anything that curls a
# page is over the line). It also discards cmd's exit code, so a 404 yields an
# empty capture that grep merely fails to match rather than a failed line.
# If you do use it: single pipe only, no intermediate tail/awk/sed stage between
# capture and grep (T-2090) — the middle stage is what `grep -q` slams its stdin
# on, and grep scans the whole captured string anyway, so the `tail -3` was
# cosmetic. `echo "$out" | grep -q PAT`, nothing between.
#
# TEST RUNNERS need a guard either way (T-2738). `set -e` is suppressed inside the
# `if` condition the gate runs each line in, so in `cmd1; cmd2` only cmd2 is the
# verdict — and the pass marker you grep for survives a partial failure: a suite
# printing "3 failed, 9 passed" satisfies `grep -q "9 passed"`, and generalising
# to `grep -qE "[0-9]+ passed"` matches the same output. Keep the exit code:
#     python3 -m pytest <file> -q > /tmp/.out 2>&1 && grep -q passed /tmp/.out
# or add the guard the exit code used to supply:
#     out=$(python3 -m pytest <file> -q 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q passed && ! echo "$out" | grep -q failed
#     out=$(bats <file> 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -q '^ok 1 ' && ! echo "$out" | grep -q '^not ok'
# The close gate refuses the unguarded form. Bypass: FW_ALLOW_UNJUDGED_TEST_RUN=1.
#
# REHEARSING A LINE BY HAND DOES NOT REHEARSE THE GATE (T-2743). Your interactive
# shell has no `set -eo pipefail`. A line has returned 0 by hand and 141 under
# P-011, from the same directory, the same second. To rehearse for real:
#     bash -c 'set -eo pipefail; <your verification line>'
#
# Enforcement-baseline hint (L-398, T-1886): if you edited `.claude/settings.json`
# (added/removed/reorganised hooks), add `bin/fw enforcement baseline` to your
# Verification block. Otherwise the canonical hash diverges and `fw doctor`
# reports a FAIL ("Enforcement baseline CHANGED") that accumulates silently.
# Origin: T-1849/T-1730/T-1731 each added a legitimate hook without refreshing
# the baseline — FAIL sat for multiple sessions until T-1886 cleaned up.

# The component is present in the toolchain, which it was not before.
rustup component list --installed > /tmp/.t3056-c 2>&1 && grep -q "rust-analyzer" /tmp/.t3056-c

# The shim now resolves to a real binary instead of printing
# "error: Unknown binary 'rust-analyzer' in official toolchain".
rust-analyzer --version > /tmp/.t3056-v 2>&1 && grep -qE "^rust-analyzer [0-9]" /tmp/.t3056-v

# The operator's standalone constraint, asserted structurally: ZERO MCP servers (so no
# service is contacted, commercial or otherwise) and out-of-process execution (so no
# always-on model context cost). This is the property that makes it the right kind of
# plugin for this project, independent of how useful it is.
claude plugin details rust-analyzer-lsp > /tmp/.t3056-d 2>&1 && grep -q "MCP servers (0)" /tmp/.t3056-d && grep -q "no model context cost" /tmp/.t3056-d

# NOT SHELL-VERIFIABLE, recorded rather than pretended: the AC that the LSP ANSWERS a
# query was closed by an actual LSP tool call, not a shell command. documentSymbol on
# crates/termlink-protocol/src/lib.rs returned 7 modules, 5 typed constants
# ([u8; 2], usize, u32), function signatures (fn(s: &str) -> String) and a nested tests
# module with 9 functions. A shell check could only have proven the binary runs, which
# is the weaker claim the symptom did not rest on.

## RCA

<!-- REQUIRED for bug-class tasks (workflow_type=build with bug-tag, OR title matches
     fix/bug/rca/broken/crash/error/regression/fail/hotfix).
     Non-bug-class tasks may leave this section empty or remove it.

     For bug-class, fill in:
       **Symptom:** what was observed (the user-facing manifestation).
       **Root cause:** the specific structural/logical gap — not "the code was wrong".
       **Why structurally allowed:** what in the framework/code/tooling let this go undetected.
       **Prevention:** what catches the next instance (test/lint/gate/doc/learning) — distinct from the fix itself.

     The completion gate (T-1550, G-019) blocks --status work-completed when
     bug-class AND this section is empty/template-only. Use --skip-rca to bypass (logged).
-->

**Symptom:** an LSP `workspaceSymbol` call returned
`LSP server plugin:rust-analyzer-lsp:rust-analyzer crashed with exit code 1`.

**Root cause:** `/root/.cargo/bin/rust-analyzer` exists on PATH but is a rustup SHIM.
`rustup component list --installed` showed cargo, clippy, rust-docs, rust-std, rustc,
rustfmt — and no rust-analyzer. Running the shim printed
`error: Unknown binary 'rust-analyzer' in official toolchain`, exiting non-zero, which
the LSP host reports as a crash. The plugin was never at fault.

**Why it stayed hidden:** the failure mode is maximally misleading. `command -v
rust-analyzer` succeeds, so every cheap check says the tool is installed. Only running
it reveals the shim, and only an LSP call reveals the consequence. Nothing in the repo
or the plugin layer asserts that an enabled LSP actually answers — so the highest-value
tool for a 7-crate Rust workspace sat broken while looking present.

**Cost of the gap:** every symbol lookup in this repo has been done with grep. The
plugin costs ~0 tokens (out-of-process), so this was pure upside that never worked.

**Prevention (distinct from the fix):** not attempted here, and recorded as the honest
gap. A check that an enabled LSP answers a real query would have caught this, and would
generalise to the wider class this repo keeps meeting — a capability that is installed,
enabled, and dark. Left as a candidate rather than built, because it belongs to the
plugin layer rather than to this task.

## Evolution

<!-- REQUIRED for arc-tagged build tasks (tags include arc:*). Captures how
     understanding evolved during build — what was learned that wasn't known at
     filing, what in the original plan no longer fits, what triggered pivots
     or new sub-tasks. Mandatory at slice boundaries (when applicable) and
     before --status work-completed.

     Origin: T-1717 grill Q4 — "the understanding of what we need and want
     evolves with the process of materialisation." Structural counter to §ACD:
     spec-vs-build divergence is logged as soon as it happens, not lost as
     folklore.

     Format (one entry per slice boundary or significant insight):
       ### YYYY-MM-DD — [topic]
       - **What changed:** [what we learned that we didn't know at filing]
       - **Plan impact:** [what in the plan no longer fits]
       - **Triggered:** [new sub-task / pivot / scope cut, with task ID if filed]

     The completion gate (T-1718) blocks --status work-completed when this
     section exists but is empty/template-only. Use --skip-evolution to bypass
     (logged Tier-2). Non-arc tasks may leave this empty.
-->

## Recommendation

<!-- T-2945: same shape as inception.md's block — the gate that reads it
     (audit_inception_recommendation, lib/task-audit.sh:117) is shared, so the
     shape is copied rather than reinvented.

     REQUIRED once this task reaches partial-complete: Agent ACs done, at least
     one `### Human` AC still unticked. `lib/review.sh:205-211` (T-2421) BLOCKS
     `fw task review` emission for build/refactor/test/decommission tasks in that
     state with no substantive block here — the operator would otherwise open
     /review/<id> to a blank Recommendation card and be asked to approve a form.

     Not required while every Human AC is ticked or the task has none: the gate
     only fires on the partial-complete transition. It is here from the start so
     you write it while you still have the evidence, not when the gate refuses.

     Format (the parser wants the `**Recommendation:**` line at the start of a
     line; a leading `-` or `*` bullet is also accepted):
     **Recommendation:** GO / NO-GO / DEFER
     **Rationale:** Why (cite evidence — what shipped, what was proven, what remains)
     **Evidence:**
     - Finding 1
     - Finding 2

     DEFER is for evidence gaps, not confidence gaps (CLAUDE.md §Presenting Work
     for Human Review). If the artefact is complete and you still don't want to
     commit, that is a calibration failure — recommend GO or NO-GO.
-->

## Decisions

<!-- Record decisions ONLY when choosing between alternatives.
     Skip for tasks with no meaningful choices.
     Format:
     ### [date] — [topic]
     - **Chose:** [what was decided]
     - **Why:** [rationale]
     - **Rejected:** [alternatives and why not]
-->

## Decision

<!-- Filled at completion of inception tasks via:
     fw inception decide T-XXX go|no-go|defer --rationale "..."

     For non-inception tasks this section is ignored. Kept in template
     so `fw inception decide` (lib/inception.sh) finds the anchor heading
     without auto-creating; T-1832 added auto-create as fallback for
     legacy tasks lacking this section. -->
