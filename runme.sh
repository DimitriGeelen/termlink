# runme.sh — pending operator actions for 010-termlink.
#
# Run this from the project root instead of pasting commands:
#
#     sudo ./runme.sh --dry-run     # read what it intends to do
#     sudo ./runme.sh --decide T-3055=go        # record ONE human decision
#     sudo ./runme.sh --disable-mismatch-plugins  # opt-in plugin cleanup
#     sudo ./runme.sh               # do it
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Operator steps were being handed over as copy-pasteable shell
# lines. That puts correct transcription on the human, leaves no record of what
# was asked, and — worst — cannot check itself: the operator runs it and both
# sides assume it worked. That is the same silent-failure class this repo's whole
# guard layer exists to prevent, reproduced in the one place a human is acting.
#
# So every action here VERIFIES itself after running and this script exits
# non-zero if any verification fails. A green run is evidence, not an assumption.
#
# IDEMPOTENT: each action checks whether it is already done and skips if so. Safe
# to re-run at any time; that is the point, not a caveat.
#
# Actions are removed once they are permanently done and no longer pending, so a
# short file means little is waiting on you.
#
# Exit: 0 all actions done+verified · 1 an action failed verification · 2 refused
