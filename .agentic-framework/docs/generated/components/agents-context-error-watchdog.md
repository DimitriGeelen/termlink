## What It Does

Error Watchdog — PostToolUse hook for Bash error detection
Detects failed Bash commands and injects investigation reminder (L-037/FP-007)
When a Bash command fails with a high-confidence error pattern, this hook
outputs JSON with additionalContext telling the agent to investigate the
root cause before proceeding — structural enforcement of CLAUDE.md §Error Protocol.
Detection strategy (conservative to avoid false positives):
1. Only fires for Bash tool calls
2. Skips exit code 0 (success)
3. For exit code 1: only warns on high-confidence stderr patterns
4. For exit codes 126, 127, 137, 139: always warns (never benign)
