## What It Does

Dispatch Guard — PostToolUse hook for Task/TaskOutput result size
Warns when sub-agent results exceed safe thresholds (G-008 enforcement)
Three incidents (T-073, T-158, T-170) proved that unbounded tool output
crashes sessions. This hook provides a structural warning layer.
Detection:
1. Only fires for Task and TaskOutput tool calls
2. Measures tool_response content length
3. Warns if >5K chars (indicates agent returned content instead of writing to disk)
Exit code: always 0 (PostToolUse hooks are advisory, cannot block)
Output: JSON with additionalContext when oversized results detected
